# microstream-docs-site
Antora build and GitHub pages for MicroStream's documentation.

The master branch contains the Antora playbook which builds the manual from the main repo. This is done by the 'Antora Site with Lunr Search' action. Its output will be pushed to the site branch, which contains the static GitHub pages stuff.
The API docs are pushed to the site branch as well.
