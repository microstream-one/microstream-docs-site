cacheManager.createCache(\"jCache\", configuration); cache.put(1, \"Hello World\"); String value = cache.get(1); Get the default CachingProvider implementation from the application’s classpath. This method will work if and only if there is only one JCache implementation available in the classpath. If there are multiple providers then use the fully qualified name + Caching.getCachingProvider(\"one.microstream.cache.types.CachingProvider\") instead. Get the default CacheManager instance using the provider. Create a cache configuration using MutableConfiguration with key type and value type as Integer and String respectively configured to store the cache entries by reference (not by value) and with an expiry time of one minute defined for entries from the moment they are created. Using the cache manager, create a cache named jCache with the configuration created in step 3. Put some data into the cache And retrieve it. The same can be done using MicroSteam’s CacheConfiguration API. This time we use a EmbeddedStorageManager as a backing store for the cache. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); CachingProvider provider = (one.microstream.cache.CachingProvider)Caching.getCachingProvider(); CacheManager cacheManager = provider.getCacheManager(); CacheConfiguration configuration = CacheConfiguration .Builder(Integer.class, String.class, \"jCache\", storageManager) .expiryPolicyFactory(CreatedExpiryPolicy.factoryOf(Duration.ONE_HOUR)) .build(); Cache cache = cacheManager.createCache(\"jCache\", configuration); cache.put(1, \"one\"); String value = cache.get(1);","title":"Getting Started","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"getting-started","url":"/manual/5.0/cache/getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Hello World","hash":"_hello_world","id":2}]},"2":{"id":2,"text":"Since version 3 MicroStream provides a JCache (JSR-107) implementation, which is optionally backed by the MicroStream Storage. JCache standardizes caching for the Java platform. It provides a common mechanism to cache values in a map-like structure. It expedites the mainstream adoption of in-memory computing by giving all Java developers an easy way to access memory from within Java. Businesses can change providers without rewriting their applications or maintaining a proprietary cache abstraction layer. This caching standard is used in a wide variety of environments. The most common use cases are: Second-level cache in JPA (e.g. Hibernate) Spring Cache Abstraction and many more Why another JCache implementation, you may wonder. There is already a myriad of providers out there. MicroStream’s very own serialization and storage can be utilized to get the best out of caches. For example you are not limited to java.io.Serializable types, when storing by value. That means every key-value pair gets copied every time you put and get entries in and out of a cache. And if a cache is used with a backing store, MicroStream’s storage can be used to get the best possible performance. And now, MicroStream being a JCache provider, you can use it as a drop-in replacement in your existing application. The caching provider represents the implementation of JCache that you are using. You can use more than one JCache implementation in your project if you wish, and CachingProvider is how you access the different providers that are in use. It is responsible for managing and providing access to many named caches. The cache holds the different values being cached. You can have several caches, each of which may be holding data for a different purpose. Each one can have a different configuration; for example, different caches may evict old data using different techniques. Each item of data in a cache is an entry, which is a key-value pair. The key is a unique value used to store and look up the data. The value is the actual data you wish to cache. Caches have some different properties than Maps, but the calls that you would use to store and lookup data is very similar.","title":"Cache","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/5.0/cache/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","hash":"_motivation","id":1},{"text":"Basic Concepts of JCache","hash":"_basic_concepts_of_jcache","id":2},{"text":"CachingProvider","hash":"_cachingprovider","id":3},{"text":"CacheManager","hash":"_cachemanager","id":4},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":5},{"text":"Entry","hash":"_entry","id":6}]},"3":{"id":3,"text":"Bugfix release. Fixed buffer flush regression [225] Bugfix release. Fixed broken build for microstream-storage-restclient-app This release introduces some breaking changes. To fully support the Java Module System (Jigsaw) and to meet Maven’s naming standards, we had to rename some packages and our artifact’s IDs. But don’t worry. Just change the dependency configuration and organize some imports, and you are good to go. Existing storages are not affected and are fully compatible with this version. For detailed information, see the migration guide below. General purpose configuration layer on which the storage and cache configuration are now based on, with following key features: Tree like structure to support sub-configurations Input from various sources (ini, xml, yaml, …​) Typed getters for properties Extendable: custom property parsers and configuration loaders Adaptable: easy adaption to other framework’s configurations, like e.g. Spring Boot Storage configuration now supports different file systems for live storage and backup GraalVM support: MicroStream’s optimized memory adapter is now used automatically when running on GraalVM Restructured MicroStream’s module and package structure to fully support the Java Module System and adopt Maven naming standards, see Migration Guide Fixed sporadic index out of bounds exception when

File System Abstraction to support a variety of storage targets. Exporter API for storage configuration. Better error handling in housekeeping, to avoid storage channel thread interruptions. Fixed XML loading bug under Android. All configuration code, which includes file paths, may be rewritten to use the new Abstract File System. For example see Storage Files or Backup. Bugfix release for projects using an old non public version. Fixed bug in type dictionary parser for old legacy type handlers Added a convenience layer for defining custom type handlers Fully automatic lazy reference managing for clearing older Lazy references as free memory gets lower. Completed optimized persistence handling for remaining types in JDK that are reasonable to appear in entity graphs. E.g. Currency, Locale, URI, URL, Path Compatibility with projects using java modules (\"jigsaw\") Added JavaDoc for common types like StorageConnection, StorageManager, StorageController, etc. Auto-recognition for CSV separator character in configuration files (e.g. legacy type mapping) JSR-107 compatible JCache provider with additional Hibernate cache region factory Storage REST Service and Client are available to access the storage data via REST, a Java-Wrapper thereof and a Web-UI Fixed a potential race condition during loading Fixed a potential race condition and robustness issue during storing StorageConnectionFoundation instance is now properly created on demand. Removed unnecessary memory consumption exponential to channel count. Improved exception messages on invalid configuration values (file sizes etc.) Workarounded a JDK bug regarding file locking when importing files (JDK exception says another process is locking the file which is outright wrong) Fixed type resolving problems when different ClassLoaders are involved. Fixed a bug that caused loading of zero-length arrays to throw an exception despite everything being fine. Various smaller bugfixes for unnecessary exceptions in special cases and state robustness after exceptions. From 2.2 no actions are necessary, for older versions see below. Removed SelfStoring without replacement since it could not be used recursively and has no advantages over just creating a static storing utility method for a certain entity. Added state validation of value type objects (e.g. String, Integer, BigDecimal, etc.) upon loading. This is hardly relevant in practice, but not having it can lead to confusing hello-world-like test applications. EmbeddedStorageManager now implements java.lang.AutoClosable. Replaced all provisional RuntimeExceptions with either PersistenceException or StorageException, depending on the architectural level the corresponding source code it located. The two technically different root handling concepts (\"default\" and \"custom\") have been consolidated in a way that they are the same thing on the API level and interchangeable, meaning no more confusion with those root exception messages. All entity fields of type transient EmbeddedStorageManager now get a reference to the used EmbeddedStorageManager instance set upon loading/updating. The interfaces around storage managing have been enhanced so that it is now equally valid to just write StorageManager instead of EmbeddedStorageManager. (An EmbeddedStorageManager \"is a\" StorageManager) Slight technical consolidation of Lazy reference handling caused the type Lazy to be moved from the package one.microstream.persistence.lazy to one.microstream.reference. The reason is that the lazy handling has actually no inherent connection to persistence or storage. It’s actually just a generic concept that can be used by those layers. See Migration Guide below on how to adjust existing projects. Fixed an off-heap memory leak when restarting the storage multiple times in the same process. Fixed a bug where changing the fields of an entity type caused an exception. This was a regression bug from fixing a similar problem for another case in version 2.1. Now, both cases work correctly. All occurrences in user code of one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy have to be refactored to one.microstream.reference.Lazy. Modern IDEs provide a functionality to \"auto-import\" missing types or automatically \"organize imports\", so this should be resolved with a proverbial push of a button. Android support MicroStream is now Java-wise fully compatible with Android. Replaced all usages of java.util.File with java.nio.file.Path to allow using custom file implementations. Improved skipping functionality of Storers (see EmbeddedStorageManager#createStorer and Storer#skip). The class Lazy is now an interface to allow custom implementations. See Migration guide below. Fixed a few minor bugs in the skipping functionality of Storers. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after the storage was shut down. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after an exception in storage initialization. Enums defining an abstract method are now handled correctly. By default, all threads created by MicroStream now start with the prefix \"MicroStream-\". This can be customized by the new interface StorageThreadNameProvider. Fixed a NullPointerException in import. Fixed a bug that caused enums with a certain field layout to be loaded inconsistently. java.util.Locale is now persisted and created using Locale’s #toLanguageTag and #forLanguageTag. In the directory of an existing storage, in the TypeDictionary file (default name \"PersistenceTypeDictionary.ptd\"), all occurrences of \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy\" must be replaced with \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy$Default\".","title":"Changelog","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"changelog","url":"/manual/5.0/intro/changelog.html","titles":[{"text":"5.0.2","hash":"_5_0_2","id":1},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes","id":2},{"text":"5.0.1","hash":"_5_0_1","id":3},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_2","id":4},{"text":"5.0","hash":"_5_0","id":5},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features","id":6},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_3","id":7},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide","id":8},{"text":"Artifacts","hash":"_artifacts","id":9},{"text":"Packages","hash":"_packages","id":10},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":11},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":12},{"text":"Storage","hash":"_storage","id":13},{"text":"4.1","hash":"_4_1","id":14},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_2","id":15},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_4","id":16},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide_2","id":17},{"text":"4.0","hash":"_4_0","id":18},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_3","id":19},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_5","id":20},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide_3","id":21},{"text":"3.0.1","hash":"_3_0_1","id":22},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_6","id":23},{"text":"3.0","hash":"_3_0","id":24},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_4","id":25},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_7","id":26},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide_4","id":27},{"text":"2.2","hash":"_2_2","id":28},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_5","id":29},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_8","id":30},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"2_2_migration-guide","id":31},{"text":"2.1","hash":"_2_1","id":32},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_6","id":33},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_9","id":34},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"_migration_guide_5","id":35}]},"4":{"id":4,"text":"You can find the MicroStream libraries in the Maven Central repository.

Usable directly in the program code of a Java application to communicate with other applications or processes. The concrete form of persistence is left open and delivered via a specific implementation as a plugin.

Usable as a common, abstract base for all technologies implementing a specific persistent representation like binary data, CSV, XML or Json. From a technical point of view, storage as well as serialization is a process that puts a graph of Java instances into a persistent form. The only difference is that network communication serialization discards this persistent form while a database solution preserves it. microstream-persistence-binary Extension of the persistence base framework with a concrete implementation of the persistent form as binary data. This persistent form is superior to all text-based formats in storage and performance needs, making it the preferred method for storage and network serialization. microstream-persistence-binary-jdk8 Specialized type handlers for JDK 8 collection types. microstream-storage Basic framework to manage a graph of Java data persisted as binary data as a database. Can be used both to implement an embedded database solution (in the same process as the Java application) and a standalone or server-mode database solution (in a separate process). Other forms of persistence than binary data are deliberately not supported because they would not bring any noteworthy advantages but many disadvantages for the task. microstream-storage-embedded Top-level framework for use in a Java application that adds an embedded database solution to its object graphs.

But the managing thread accessing it can. When an EmbeddedStorageManager is \"started\" it is actually just setup with all kinds of default and user-defined settings and definitions. What is actually \"started\" are the database managing threads that process storing and loading requests. // Setup the database manager and start the managing threads EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); Of course, for every start() method, there needs to be something like a shutdown() method. So there is in MicroStream: // Stop accessing the database storageManager.shutdown(); But is it really necessary to call shutdown? Should it be? What if there’s an error and the process stops without calling shutdown()? Will that cause the database to become inconsistent, corrupted, maybe even destroyed? The answer is: It wouldn’t be much of a database solution if a crash could cause any problem in the persisted data. MicroStream data-store is carefully designed in such a fashion that the process it runs in can simply vanish at any point in time and the persisted data will never be corrupted. This is surprisingly simple and reliable to solve: Whenever a .store() call returns, it is guaranteed that the data stored by it has been physically written to the underlying storage layer, usually a file system. Before that, there is no guarantee regarding written data at all. In fact, should the process die before the last byte has been written and secured, the next StorageManager initialization will recognize that and truncate the last partially written store. Either way, all the data that was guaranteed to be written will be consistently available after the next .start(). As a consequence, this safety mechanism makes an explicit .shutdown() call pretty much unnecessary. It doesn’t hurt, but it is effectively more-less the same as just calling System.exit(0);. The only time when an explicit shutdown is really needed is, if the database managing threads shall be stopped but the application itself keeps running. For example, it is perfectly valid to start the StorageManager, work with the database, then stop it, maybe change some configuration or copy files or something like that and then start it up again to continue working. In any other case, the shutdown method can be ignored and the live database can happily just be \"killed\" while running. It is specifically designed to withstand such a treatment. Any live MicroStream database basically consists of three major parts: A place where the persisted data is located. Usually a file system directory. The managing threads accessing (read and write) the persisted data. The EmbeddedStorageManager instance to use and control the database in the application. Apart from a lot of internal components (configuration, processing logic, housekeeping state, etc.), that’s all there is. There is nothing special or \"magic\" about it, no static state, no global registration in the JVM process or something like that. The consequence of this is: If two EmbeddedStorageManager instances are started, each one with a different location for its persistend data, then the application has two live databases! If three or ten or 100 are started, then that’s the number of live databases the application has. There is no limit and no conflict between different databases inside the same application process.

In line 6 the current storage’s content is printed. Line 7 assigns some data to the storage, replacing existing data if there is some. In line 8 everything gets stored. When using MicroStream, your entire database is accessed starting at a root instance. This instance is the root object of an object graph that gets persisted by the MicroStream storage logic. While the root instance can be of any type (for example just a collection or an array), it is a good idea to define an explicit root type specific for the application. In this simple example, it is a class called DataRoot, which wraps a single String. public class DataRoot { private String content; public DataRoot() { super(); } public String getContent() { return this.content; } public void setContent(final String content) { this.content = content; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Root: \" + this.content; } } For further information, see root instances. The following code is all that is required to setup a an application backed by a MicroStream database. The application’s convenience root instance is defined and an EmbeddedStorageManager instance, linked to the root, is created (and its database managing threads are started). This is a fully operational Java database application. // Application-specific root instance final DataRoot root = new DataRoot(); // Initialize a storage manager (\"the database\") with the given directory. final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start( root, // root object Paths.get(\"data\") // storage directory ); // Set content data to the root element, including the time to visualize // changes on the next execution. root.setContent(\"Hello World! @ \" + new Date()); // Store the modified root and its content. storageManager.storeRoot(); This call is all that is necessary to store data in the simplest case. Best practice is to safely shutdown the storage manager by simply calling: storageManager.shutdown(); storageManager.storeRoot() is a special case method that always stores the root object. If you want to store any other object than the root itself, just call storageManager.store(modifiedObject) The full code for the Hello World example is on GitHub.","title":"Getting Started","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"getting-started","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Hello World","hash":"_hello_world","id":2},{"text":"The Root Instance","hash":"_the_root_instance","id":3},{"text":"Creating a Database","hash":"creating-a-database","id":4},{"text":"Storing Data","hash":"_storing_data","id":5},{"text":"Stopping a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_a_live_database","id":6}]},"10":{"id":10,"text":"Housekeeping is an internal background logic to optimize the database’s usage of memory and persistent storage space (typically disc space). It is comprised of mechanisms for cleaning up storage files, clearing unneeded cached data and recognizing deleted entities via garbage collection. Housekeeping is performed with a configurable time budget in configurable intervals to make sure it never interferes with the application’s work load too much (see housekeeping configuration). If new versions of an entity are stored or if entities become no longer reachable (meaning the become effectively deleted or \"garbage\" data), their older data is no longer needed. However, the byte sequences representing that old data still exist in the storage files. But since they will never be needed again, they become logical \"gaps\" in the storage files. Space that is occupied, but will never be read again. It might as well be all zeroes or not exist at all. Sadly, unwanted areas cannot simple by \"cut\" from files. Above all because that would ruin all file offsets coming after them. So with every newly stored version of an entity and every entity that is recognized as unreachable \"garbage\", a storage file consists more and more of useless \"gaps\" and less and less of actually used data. This makes the storage space less and less efficient. To prevent eventually ending up with a drive that is filled with useless bytes despite an actually not that big database, the files need to be \"cleaned up\" from time to time. To do this, the Housekeeping occasionally scans the storage files. If their \"payload\" ratio goes below the configured limit, the affected files will be retired: all data that belongs to still live entities is copied to a new file. Then the old file consists of 100% unneeded gap data and can safely be deleted. Which ratio value to set in the configuration is a matter of taste or, more precisely, depends on each individual application’s demands. A value of 1.0 (100%) means: only files with 100% payload, so no gaps at all, are acceptable. This means that for every store that contains at least one new version of an already existing entity, the corresponding storage file will contain the slightest gap, thus dropping below the demanded ratio of 100% and as a consequence, will be retired on the next occasion. This very aggressive cleanup strategy will keep the disc space usage at a perfect minimum, but at the cost of enormous amounts of copied data, since virtually every store will cause one or more storage files to be retired and their content be shifted into a new file. Respectively, a value of 0.0 (0%) means something like: \"Never care about gaps, just fill up the disc until it bursts.\" This keeps the disc write loads for the file cleanup at 0, but at the cost of rapidly eating up disc space. The best strategy most probably lies somewhere in between. Somewhere between 0.1 and 0.9 (10% and 90%). The default value is 0.75 (75%). So a storage file containing up to 25% of unused gap data is okay. Containing more gaps that 25% will cause a storage file to be retired. In addition to the payload ratio check, the file cleanup also retired files tha are too small or too big. For example: The application logic might commit a single store that is 100 MB in size. But the storage files are configured to be no larger than 10 MB (for example to keep a single file cleanup nice and fast). A single store is always written as a whole in the currently last storage file. The reason for this is to process the store as fast as possible and quickly return control to the application logic. When the housekeeping file cleanup scan encounters such an oversized file, it will retire it immediately by splitting it up across 10 smaller files and then deleting the oversized file. A similar logic applies to files that are too small. Upper and lower size bounds can be freely configured to arbitrary values. The defaults are 1 MB and 8 MB. To avoid repeated reads to storage files (which are incredibly expensive compared to just reading memory), data of once loaded entities is cached in memory. If an entity’s cached data is not requested again for a certain amount of time in relation to how much data is already cached, it is cleared from the cache to avoid unnecessarily consuming memory. The mechanism to constantly evaluate and clear cached data where applicable, is part of the housekeeping. The aggressiveness of this mechanism can be configured via the housekeeping configuration. In a reference-based (or graph-like) data paradigm, instances never have to be deleted explicitly. For example, there is no \"delete\" in the java language. There are only references. If those references are utilized correctly, deleting can be done fully automatically without any need for the developer to care about it. This is called \"garbage collection\". The concept is basically very simple: when the last reference to an instance is cut, that instance can never be accessed again. It becomes \"garbage\" that occupies memory with it data that is not needed any longer. To identify those garbage instances, all an algorithm (the \"garbage collector\") has to do is to follow every reference, starting at some defined root instance (or several) of a graph and mark every instance it encounters as \"reachable\". When it has no more unvisited instances in its queue, the marking is completed. Every instance that is not marked as reachable by then must be unreachable garbage and will be deleted from memory. Similar to the JVM’s garbage collection to optimize its memory consumption, MicroStream has a garbage collection of its own, but for the level of persistent storage space instead of memory space. However, MicroStreams multi-threaded garbage collector is currently still in development and not activated, yet. Housekeeping can also be triggered manually from the StorageConnection . Related methods are: issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, entityEvaluator) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullCacheCheck() issueFullCacheCheck(entityEvaluator) issueFullFileCheck() issueFullFileCheck(fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullGarbageCollection() issueGarbageCollection(nanoTimeBudget) All Housekeeping methods can be given a defined time budget or can be run until full completion.","title":"Housekeeping","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"housekeeping","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/housekeeping.html","titles":[{"text":"File cleanup:","hash":"_file_cleanup","id":1},{"text":"Cache cleanup","hash":"_cache_cleanup","id":2},{"text":"Garbage collection","hash":"_garbage_collection","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Housekeeping","hash":"_explicit_housekeeping","id":4}]},"11":{"id":11,"text":"MicroStream provides an API to import and export persisted data of the storage.

From a technical point of view it serves one purpose only: To fully or partially persist and restore a Java object graph in the simplest way possible for the user. MicroStream Data-Store is a storage engine, but no database management system (DBMS). Many features that typical DBMS provide have been left out on purpose. The reason is that those features exist to make a DBMS something of a server application platform of an \"old kind\" on top of its data store functionality: A standalone process with user management, connection management, session handling, often even with a programming language of its own, a querying interface (SQL), etc. Today, all of those server application features are already and much better handled by dedicated server applications (the \"new kind\"), implemented in a modern language like Java. They have their built-in user, connection and session management, the querying interface to the outside world are typically web services instead of SQL, etc. But those modern server applications still lack one important thing: an easy to use and technically efficient way to store and restore their application’s data. So a \"new kind\" server often uses an \"old kind\" server just to do the data storing. This comes at the price of catching all the overhead and problems of redundant user, connection and session management AND the outdated concepts and limitations of the old querying interface (SQL). Isn’t that very weird and frustratingly complicated? Why not simply include a modern data storing library in the modern server and be done with it? A storing library that perfectly fits the modern technology and brings in no redundant overhead or complication of a secondary outdated wannabe server process. This is exactly what MicroStream Data-Store is and the reason why it is intentionally not a DBMS but \"only\" a storage engine. One might think the easiest way to store and load data in Java would be Java’s built-in serialization. However, it turned out long ago to be very limited, making it hard, if not impossible, to be used as a replacement for a DBMS: Only complete object graphs can be stored and restored, which is unacceptable for all but very small databases. It is very inefficient in terms of storage size and performance. It does not handle changing class structures very well, basically forbidding classes of persisted entities to ever change or introducing massive manual effort to compensate. It cannot handle third-party classes that do not implement Serializable but cannot be changed. In short: The Java Serialization is not an acceptable data store solution and hence no valid replacement for those outdated DBMS. MicroStream Data-store is such a solution: It can persist, load or update object graphs partially and on-demand. It is very efficient both size- and performance-wise. It handles changing class structures by mapping data in the old structure to the current structure during loading; implicitly via internal heuristics or explicitly via a user-defined mapping strategy. It can automatically handle any Java constructs, only excluding those that are technically or reasonably not persistable (e.g. lambdas, proxies or instances with ties to JVM-internals like threads, etc.). MicroStream is what the Java Serialization should have been and it is the first and only really fitting data storing solution for modern applications, completely removing the need to attach a wannabe secondary server DBMS just to store data.","title":"Storage","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/index.html","titles":[]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"The MicroStream engine takes care of persisting your object graph.

One value after another as a trivial byte stream. References between objects are mapped with unique numbers, called ObjectId, or short OID. + With both combined, byte streams and OIDs, an object graph can be stored in a simple and quick way, as well as loaded, as a whole or partially. But there is a small catch. Where does it start? What is the first instance or reference at startup? + Strictly speaking \"nothing\". That’s why at least one instance or a reference to an instance must be registered in a special way, so that the application has a starting point from where the object graph can be loaded. This is a \"Root Instance\". Same difference, another problem are instances which are references by constant fields in Java classes. These aren’t created when the records are loaded from the database, but by the JVM while loading the classes. Without special treatment, this would be a problem: The application, meaning the JVM or the JVM process, starts, the constant instances are created by the JVM, one or more of them are stored, then the application shuts down. The stored data of the constants are now stored with a certain OID in the database. The application starts again. The Constant instances are created again by the JVM. The data records are read by MicroStream. The problem is: How should the application know what values, which are stored with a certain OID, belong to which constant? The JVM created everything from scratch at startup and doesn’t know anything about OIDs. To resolve this, the constant instances must be registered, just like the entity graph’s root instance. Then MicroStream can associate the constant instances with the stored data via the OIDs. Constant instances can be thought of as JVM-created implicit root instances for the object graph. In both cases, root and constant instances, it is about registering special starting points for the object graph in order to load it correctly. For MicroStream, from a plain technical view, both cases don’t make a difference. In the most common cases, nothing at all. The default behavior is enough to get things going. By default, a single instance can be registered as the entity graph’s root, accessible via EmbeddedStorage.root(). + Therefore, this is already a fully fledged (although tiny) database application: // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // Set the entity (graph) as root storageManager.setRoot(\"Hello World\"); // Store root storageManager.storeRoot(); The simple default approach has its limits when the application defines an explicit root instance that must be updated/filled from the database directly during database initialization. Something like this: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // root must be filled at this point... but how? root.printAllMyEntities(); To solve this, a custom root instance can be directly registered at the database setup. In the simplest case, is just has to be passed to .start();: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager with a reference to the application's root. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // root is \"magically\" filled at this point. (Yay!) root.printAllMyEntities(); Internally, the two concepts (default root and custom root) and handled by different mechanisms. This can be seen from the two different methods storageManager.defaultRoot(); storageManager.customRoot(); The simplified method storageManager.root(); automatically chooses the variant that is used. Since neither of those three methods can know the concrete type of the root instance (and adding a type parameter just for that would have been a complication overkill), they all can only be typed to return Object. So, to avoid annoying and dangerous casts, it is best to keep a direct reference to a custom root instance as shown in the code snippet above. Likewise, storageManager.storeRoot(); works for both variants, so there is no need to worry about how to store which one.","title":"Root Instances","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"root-instances","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/root-instances.html","titles":[{"text":"What Must Be Done in the Application?","hash":"_what_must_be_done_in_the_application","id":1},{"text":"Custom Root Instances","hash":"_custom_root_instances","id":2}]},"15":{"id":15,"text":"The default way to configure a JCache provider is to use the class javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration.

This is useful to optimize the performance for storing complex objects or in the rare case that it is not possible to store a type with the default type handlers. There are two strategies for a simplified type handler implementation. Implementing a class that extends CustomBinaryHandler and defines a sequence of BinaryFields via the #Field~ static pseudo-constructor methods. Everything else like setting the name, calculating the binary offsets, etc. is then done implicitly via reflection. Example on GitHub This example implements a custom type handler for the java.awt.image.BufferedImage class. Instead of storing the rather complex object structure of that class the image is serialized as PNG image format using javax.imageio.ImageIO into a byte array. This byte array is then stored by MicroStream. The custom type handler must be registered in the CustomTypeHandlerRegistry to enable it: EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage .Foundation(WORKINGDIR) .onConnectionFoundation(f -> f.registerCustomTypeHandlers(new CustomBufferedImageHandler()) ) .start(ROOT); Implementing a class can be skipped altogether by using the method Binary#TypeHandler and passing the BinaryFields directly. Registering such a generically created TypeHandler is not required, either, since Version 3 of MicroStream brought a solution to just define a static method in the entity class that will be recognized and used by MicroStream. The following is a simple technical example on how a custom binary handler can be easily defined and technically leveraged to optimize storage behavior. E.g. imagine having millions of such objects that now only create 1 database record with a fraction of the required storage space instead of 4 records but hold the same information. public class Employee { /* * Fields with primitive data are (for whatever reason, e.g. project * design rules) all object types, but records should be stored as * efficient as possible, i.e. without overhead of references and value objects. * * MicroStream's generic type analysis does not know of this and hence cannot * do it. But defining a custom type handler can */ String id ; Double salary ; Date dateOfBirth; // constructor, getters, setters, etc /* * The entity class must just contain \"any\" method returning a suitable type * handler and MicroStream will recognize it and use the returned handler * automatically. * * Type type handler just needs to specify the entity class and define a list * of fields comprised of (name, getter, setter) in arbitrary order. */ static BinaryTypeHandler provideTypeHandler() { return Binary.TypeHandler( Employee.class, Binary.Field_long(\"id\", e -> Long.parseLong(e.id), (e, value) -> e.id = String.valueOf(value) ), Binary.Field_long(\"dateOfBirth\", e -> e.dateOfBirth.getTime(), (e, value) -> e.dateOfBirth = new Date(value) ), Binary.Field_double(\"salary\", e -> e.salary.longValue(), (e, value) -> e.salary = Double.valueOf(value) ) ); } } Full example is available on GitHub.","title":"Custom Type Handler","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"custom-type-handler","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/customizing/custom-type-handler.html","titles":[{"text":"Implementation","hash":"_implementation","id":1},{"text":"A Custom Binary Handler","hash":"_a_custom_binary_handler","id":2},{"text":"A Static Provider Method","hash":"_a_static_provider_method","id":3}]},"25":{"id":25,"text":"When a reference to the loading storage is needed in entities, e.g. usage of different tenants or to store its internal state in a tailored fashion, this can be done by this little trick.

This also allows the actual data instance to be immutable, while at the same time leaving referential integrity of an entity graph intact. MicroStream provides ready-to-use logic layers for: Logging Versioning While the layers admittedly introduce considerable technical complexity and runtime overhead, this concept is a production ready solution for nearly all requirements regarding cross cutting concerns and aspects. To use this concept in your code, there need to be at least implementations for the entity’s identity and data. Let’s say the entity looks like this: public interface Person extends Entity { public String firstName(); public String lastName(); } There needs to be a identity class: public class PersonEntity extends EntityLayerIdentity implements Person { protected PersonEntity() { super(); } @Override protected Person entityData() { return (Person)super.entityData(); } @Override public final String firstName() { return this.entityData().firstName(); } @Override public final String lastName() { return this.entityData().lastName(); } } And a data class: public class PersonData extends EntityData implements Person { private final String firstName; private final String lastName ; protected PersonData(final Person entity, final String firstName, final String lastName ) { super(entity); this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName ; } @Override public String firstName() { return this.firstName; } @Override public String lastName() { return this.lastName; } } A lot of code to write to get an entity with two properties! But don’t worry, there is a code generator for that. An annotation processor to be precise. The only code you have to provide are the entity interfaces, all the other stuff will be generated. Just add the annotation processor type one.microstream.entity.codegen.EntityProcessor to your compiler configuration. That’s it.

So you can control versioning for multiple entities at once, or even for the hole entity graph. The auto-incrementing contexts take care of the key creation. If you need to control it by yourself, use the mutable context. But be aware that you have to set the version before updating any data, otherwise the current one will be overwritten.

All types in the public API are, whenever possible, interfaces. This offers the best possibilities to extend or exchange parts of the engine. A good ways to enrich a type with features, is the wrapper (decorator) pattern. For example, let’s say we want to add logging to the PersistenceStoring's store(object) method. PersistenceStoring.java public interface PersistenceStoring { public long store(Object instance); public long[] storeAll(Object... instances); public void storeAll(Iterable instances); public void storeSelfStoring(SelfStoring storing); } Conventionally it would be done that way: A new type, implementing the original interface, would be handed over the wrapped instance, all interface methods have to be implemented and delegated. And in the single method, we wanted to add functionality; the actual implementation of the logging is done. public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } This produces a lot of overhead. In this case, three methods are just boilerplate code to delegate the calls to the wrapped instance. A common solution for that is to create an abstract base wrapper type for the designated interface, and to reuse it whenever needed. public abstract class BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } And then, based on that, the implementation of the logger type would look like this: public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging extends BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring { public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(wrapped); } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return super.store(instance); } } That’s better. No more boilerplate code. Just overwrite the methods you want to extend. The only work left is, to generate the base wrapper types. One way is to let your IDE generate the wrapper or delegation code. Disadvantage of that is, it has to be redone every time your interfaces change. A code generator, which does it automatically would be nice. And that’s what the base module brings along.

This offers you the most flexible way to use it in your application. The Wrapper type is just a typed interface and an abstract implementation of itself. Wrapper.java public interface Wrapper { public W wrapped(); public abstract class Abstract implements Wrapper { private final W wrapped; protected Abstract(final W wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public final W wrapped() { return this.wrapped; } } } You can either implement the Wrapper interface and provide the wrapped instance via the wrapped() method, or you can extend the abstract class and hand over the wrapped instance to the super constructor.

This renders the application and the database incompatible. It’s like in an IDE. You change the structure of a class and the tooling takes care of the rest. Problem is, in a database, the \"rest\" can be, in some circumstances, several gigabytes or even more, that have to be refactored and written again. It’s one way to do it, but there are better alternatives. At best, the data is transformed when it’s accessed only. The old (legacy) type data is being mapped to the new type when it’s being loaded, hence: Legacy Type Mapping. Nothing needs to be rewritten. All records are, as they were saved, compatible with all other versions of their type. Simply by mapping while loading. What has to be done to achieve this? In the most common cases, nothing! The heuristic attempts to automatically detect which fields are new, have been removed, reordered or altered. Contact.java (old) public class Contact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; } Contact.java (new) public class Contact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNode ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } Console Output ---------- Legacy type mapping required for legacy type 1000055:Contact to current type 1000056:Contact Fields: java.lang.String Contact#firstname -1.000 ----> java.lang.String Contact#firstname java.lang.String Contact#name -0.750 ----> java.lang.String Contact#lastname java.lang.String Contact#email -0.708 ----> java.lang.String Contact#emailAddress java.lang.String Contact#note -0.636 ----> java.lang.String Contact#supportNode [***new***] PostalAddress Contact#postalAddress int Contact#age -1.000 ----> int Contact#age java.lang.Object Contact#link [discarded] --- Write 'y' to accept the mapping. The fields in the Contact entity class have been renamed, reordered, one was removed, one is new. What the heuristic is doing now is something like this: String firstname is equal in both classes, so it has to be the same, pretty much as int age. name and lastname is pretty similar, type is the same too. If there is nothing better for the two, they probably belong together. Same with the other two fields. In the end, the ominous link and postalAddress remain. The heuristic can not make sense of that, so it assumes that one thing falls away and the other one is added. In this particular example, that worked perfectly. Well done, heuristic. But: Just as people can make mistakes in estimating similarities (\"I would have thought …​\"), even programs can make mistakes as soon as they logically go on thin ice. There is nothing more with absolute correctness that you actually know from (bug-free) software. Such a similarity matching will be correct in the most cases, but sometimes it will also fall by the wayside. Example: perhaps only PostalAddress instances were referenced in the application under link and the two fields would actually be the same, only now properly typed and named. How should heuristics know that? Nobody could know that either, if he is not privy to the details of the concrete application. That’s why Legacy Type Mapping has two mechanisms that prevent things from going wrong: A callback interface is used to create the desired mapping result: PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor Optionally, an explicit mapping can be specified, which is then preferred to the heuristic approach. If you do not want that, you can simply set another resultor. Like in this example each suspected mapping is submitted once to the user for control in the console. This is done with the InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor. Maybe even one, where the user can \"rewire\" the mapping itself, write out the mapping, and then return an appropriate result. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(myDataDir); foundation.getConnectionFoundation().setLegacyTypeMappingResultor( InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() ) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(myRoot).start(); All you need is two columns of strings: from old to new. By default MicroStream uses a CSV file, but you can also write something else. In the end, a lot of string pairs for \"old → new\" mappings have to come into the program somewhere. The concept is simple: If there are two strings, this is interpreted as a mapping from an old thing to a new thing. If the second value is missing, it is interpreted as an old thing to be deleted. Missing the first value, then it’s as a new thing. Why call it \"thing\"? Because this applies to several structural elements: Constant identifier Class names Field names Example: count; articleCount means: the field named earlier count is called articleCount in the current version of the class. count; means: the early field count should be ignored during the mapping. More specifically, the values ​​of this field per record. ;articleCount means, this is a newly added field, DO NOT try to match it with anything else heuristically. You can also mix explicit mapping and heuristics. Only explicitly specify so many changes until the analysis gets the rest right by itself. That means you never have to specify the annoying trivial cases explicitly. Only the tricky ones. Usually, nothing should be necessary at all, or maybe a view indications at most to avoid mishaps. However, those who strictly prefer to make any change explicitly, instead of trusting a \"guessing\" software, can also do that. No problem. For class names, the three variants map, add and remove are somewhat tricky in meaning: Map is just old → new, same as with fields. To make an entry for a new class doesn’t make sense. It’s covered by the new class itself. You can do it, but it has no effect. Marking a removed class as deleted makes no sense either, except one special case. It is not required to specify the fields mapping of mapped classes if the mapping heuristic can do a correct field mapping. Especially if classes have been renamed only. Classes are simply referred to by their full qualified class name: com.my.app.entities.Order In some cases you need to specify the exact Version of the class, then the TypeId has to be prepended: 1012345:com.my.app.entities.Order Mapping from old to new: com.my.app.entities.Order;com.my.app.entities.OrderImplementation For fields it’s a bit more complex. To unambiguously refer a field, the full qualified name of its defining class has to be used. com.my.app.entities.Order#count;com.my.app.entities.Order#articleCount The # is based on official Java syntax, like e.g. in JavaDoc. If inheritance is involved, which must be uniquely resolved (each class in the hierarchy can have a field named \"count\"), you must also specify the declaring class. Like this: com.my.app.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#count; ⤦ com.my.App.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#articleCount A simple example: OldContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class OldContact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; // to be discarded } NewContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class NewContact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNote ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } refactorings.csv old current com.my.app.entities.OldContact com.my.app.entities.NewContact com.my.app.entities.OldContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.NewContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#name com.my.app.entities.NewContact#lastname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#email com.my.app.entities.NewContact#emailAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#note com.my.app.entities.NewContact#supportNote com.my.app.entities.NewContact#postalAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#age com.my.app.entities.NewContact#age com.my.app.entities.OldContact#link EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(dataDir); foundation.setRefactoringMappingProvider( Persistence.RefactoringMapping(Paths.get(\"refactorings.csv\")) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(root).start(); So far so good, all classes and fields are getting mapped, automatically or manually. But what about the data? How are the values getting transformed from old to new? Technically speaking it’s done fully automatic. But there are some interesting questions: What if the primitive types changes? What if primitives change to references and vice versa? How fast is it? Let’s say int to float. Just to copy the four bytes would yield wrong results. It has to be converted, like float floatValue = (float)intValue; Can it be done? Yes, fully automatic. The class BinaryValueTranslators does the job for you, it has a converter function from each primitive to another. Currently MicroStream supports conversion between primitives and their wrapper types, and vice versa. When converting a wrapper to a primitive, null is converted to 0. If you need special conversions between object types, you can add custom BinaryValueSetter for that, see customizing. How fast is that? The type analysis happens only once during initialization. If no exception occurs, the Legacy Type Mapping is ready-configured for each necessary type and will then only be called if required. For normal entity classes that are parsed by reflection, legacy type mapping loading is just as fast as a normal load. An array of such value translator functions is put together once and they are run through each time they are loaded. With legacy mapping, only the order and the target offsets are different, but the principle is the same as with normal loading. For custom handlers an intermediate step is necessary: ​​First put all the old values ​​together in an order that the custom handler expects and then read the binary data normally, as if loading a record in the current format. That’s necessary because MicroStream can’t know what such a custom handler does internally. If someone ever uses such a custom handler, the small detour is not likely to be noticeable in terms of performance. And if it should be the case and it has a negative effect on the productive operation: No problem, because: Of course you can also write a custom legacy type handler. It would run at full speed even with tricky special cases. Of course there is the possibility, as always, of intervening in the machinery massively with customizing. If you need the highest possible performance for some cases, or for logging / debugging, or anyway: Register any value translator implementations. In the simplest case this is 1 line of code, so do not worry. Being able to specify refactoring mapping in a different way than a CSV file is another example. You can even customize (extend or replace) the strategy that is looked up in refactoring mapping. Furthermore, you can also replace the heuristic logic with your own. This is easier than it sounds. This is just a primitive little interface (PersistenceMemberSimilator) and the default implementation thereof calls e.g. just a Levenshtein algorithm for names. You can certainly do that 10 times more clever. Or \"more appropriate\" for a particular application or programming style. E.g. utilize annotations. The basic statement is: If there is a problem somewhere, whether with the heuristic or a special case request or performance problem loading a gazillion entities all at once, or if there is a need for debugging in depth or something like that: do not panic. Most likely, this is easily possible with a few lines of code. Customizing examples You can not just mark classes as deleted. As long as there are records of a certain type in the database, the corresponding class must also exist so that the instances from the database can be loaded into the application. If there are no more records, then that means that there are only a few bytes of orphaned description in the type dictionary, but nobody cares. Is it possible to delete it by hand (or rather not, there are good reasons against it) or you can just ignore it and leave it there forever. In both cases, you must not mark a class as deleted. Now the special case: In the entity graph (root instances and all recursively reachable instances from there) all references to instances of a certain type are filled in. It’s done by the application logic or possibly by a specially written script. That is, all instances of this type are unreachable. No instance is available, no instance can ever be reloaded. This means that the type is \"deleted\" from the database at the logical level. One does not have to register anywhere, that is implicitly just like that. You can actually delete the corresponding Java class from the application project because it will never be needed again during the loading process at runtime. So far so good. There is only one problem: even if the instances are never logically accessible again: the data records are still around in the database files. The initialization scans over all database files, registers all entities, collects all occurring TypeIds and ensures for every TypeId that there is a TypeHandler for it. If necessary, a LegacyTypeHandler with mapping, but still: there must be a TypeHandler for each TypeId. And a TypeHandler needs a runtime type. That is, ass-backwards, over records that are logically already deleted, but only physically still lying around, now it is again enforced that the erasable entity class must be present. Bummer. One can prevent this: there is a \"cleanup\" function in the database management logic, which cleans up all logical gaps in the database files (actually copies all non-gaps into a new file and thus deletes the old file altogether). You would have to call it, then all physical occurrences of the unreachable records disappear and you could easily delete the associated class. But that is annoying. That is why it makes sense for these cases - and only for them - to do the following: If you as a developer are absolutely sure that no single instance of a given class is ever reachable again, i.e. must be loaded, then you can mark a type as \"deleted\" (rather \"unreachable\") in the refactoring mapping. Then the Type Handling will create a dummy TypeHandler that does not need a runtime class. See PersistenceUnreachableTypeHandler. But be careful: if you are mistaken and an instance of such a type is still referenced somewhere and eventually loaded later at runtime, then the Unreachable handler will throw an exception. At some point during the runtime of the application, not even during initialization. The cleanup provides real security: remove all logical gaps and if then with a deleted class no more error in the initialization occurs, it is really superfluous. Any ideas, such as simply returning null in the dummy type handler instead of an instance, are a fire hazard: it may dissolve some annoying situations pleasantly, but it would also mean that existing datasets, potentially entire subgraphs, become hidden from the application. Nevertheless, the database would continue to drag them along, perhaps becoming inexplicably large, and any search for the reason would yield nothing, because the dummy type handler keeps the data records secret. Shortsighted great, but catastrophic in the long run. That’s not good. The only clean solution is: you have to know what to do with your data model. As long as there are still available instances, they must also be loadable. The annoying special case above can be defused without side effects. But it can not be more than that, otherwise it will get rid of the chaos, problems and lost confidence in the correctness of the database solution.","title":"Legacy Type Mapping","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatic Mapping","hash":"_automatic_mapping","id":1},{"text":"Explicit Mapping","hash":"_explicit_mapping","id":2},{"text":"Explicit Mapping of Classes","hash":"_explicit_mapping_of_classes","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Mapping Syntax","hash":"_explicit_mapping_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Value Conversion","hash":"_value_conversion","id":5},{"text":"Value Conversion of Primitives","hash":"value-conversion-of-primitives","id":6},{"text":"Value Conversion of References / Objects","hash":"value-conversion-of-references","id":7},{"text":"Performance","hash":"performance","id":8},{"text":"Customizing","hash":"customizing","id":9},{"text":"Special Case: Deleted Class","hash":"special-case-deleted-class","id":10}]},"57":{"id":57,"text":"Here is an overview of how to enable and configure different levels of user interaction for the Legacy Type Mapping. Somewhere you have a foundation instance, a foundation in where everything is configured, from which the StorageManager is created. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(); // or from somewhere else It itself contains a foundation for connections. To access the inner thing needs a little detour. Incidentally, that’s not a JDBC connection, but this is just one thing that creates helper instances like Storer and Loader. Because Legacy Type Mapping affects loading, it has to go in there. Either you access it directly, like this: EmbeddedStorageConnectionFoundation f = foundation.getConnectionFoundation(); Or like this, that’s better for method chaining. foundation.onConnectionFoundation(f -> { ... }); If you have that, the configuration for the Legacy Type Mapping callback logic is just a one liner: f.setLegacyTypeMappingResultor(...); Default PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() That’s just the necessary logic, without anything further. If you do not change anything, this is done by default. With Console Output PrintingLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) That wraps a printer around the necessary logic. All these storage and persistence classes are nothing sacred or super-duper intertwined or anything. These are just interfaces and if you plug in another implementation then it will be used. Inquiry InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) Resultor which asks the user to apply. More customization is possible, see below. And so on With the implementation of just one single interface method, you can build anything else you can imagine. For example, logging to a file instead of the console. Or in the personally preferred logging framework. Or write confirmed mappings into the refactorings file. Everything is possible. For the inquiring implementation (InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor) there are a few settings: When should he ask? Always or only if something is unclear. Never does not make any sense of course, then you shouldn’t use it, or alternatively the printing resultor. When is a mapping unclear? If at least one field mapping is not completely clear. A field mapping is clear if: If two fields are exactly the same (similarity 1.0 or 100%) Or if two fields are specified by the explicit mapping. So if all fields are clear according to the above rule, then there is no need to ask. And there is another special case: If a field is discarded that is not explicitly marked as discardable, then as a precaution an inquiry is always done. Although no data is lost, but the data would not be available in the application, so better ask. There are options to control this a bit finer. You can optionally specify a double as a threshold (from 0.0 to 1.0, otherwise Exception): The value determines how similar two matching fields automatically have to be so that they are not inquired. Example: The value is 0.9 (90%), but a match found is only 0.8 (80%) similar. This is according to the specification too little, there must be an inquiry as a precaution. If you specify 1.0, that means: always ask, everything is really perfectly clear. If you enter 0.0, this means: never ask or only for implicitly dropping fields. Looks like this: InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) // implicitely 1.0 InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(), 0.7) // 0.7 threshold Here a small example with a Person class. int customerid ; // -> pin String firstname ; // -> firstName String surname ; // -> lastName String comment ; // discarded, NOT new commerceId It should be changed to: Integer pin ; // firstName surname -0,688----> lastName comment -0,750----> commerceId [***new***] address customerid [discarded] customerid and pin are too different to be automatically assigned to each other. Therefore, it is wrongly assumed that customerid is omitted and pin is new. comment and commerceId are surprisingly similar (75%) and are therefore assigned. But that’s not what we want. Incidentally, it would not matter here what is defined as a threshold: customerid would be eliminated by the implicit decision. This is too delicate not to inquire, so it is always necessary to ask. To get the mapping right, you have to specify two entries: customerid is now called pin and comment should be omitted Then the inquiry looks like this: customerid -[mapped]-> pin firstname -0,944----> firstName surname -0,688----> lastName [***new***] commerceId [***new***] address comment [discarded] Due to the explicit mapping from customerid to pin, the similarity does not matter, it is the mapping that matters. To indicate this, it says \"[mapped]\" instead of the similarity. The rest is as usual. Only comment is now \"[discarded]\", according to the mapping. The difference to the above is namely: This is an explicitly predetermined absence. That does not force inquiry. This clears the way for the threshold: If you enter 0.7 or more then you will be asked. As far as everything would be clear, but the mapping of surname to lastName is below the required \"minimum similarity\", so rather ask. If you enter 0.6 or less, you will no longer be asked. Because all assignments are either explicitly specified or they are according to \"minimum similarity\" similar enough to rely on it. A recommendation for a good value for the \"minimum similarity\" is difficult. As soon as one softens rules, there is always the danger of a mistake. See comment example above: is 75% similar to commerceId. Still wrong. Then prefer 80%? Or 90%? Of course it is better, but the danger is still there. If you want to be sure, just make 1.0 or omit the parameter, then by default 1.0 is taken. The most important is the explicit mapping anyway : if \"enough\" is given by the user, there is no need to ask.","title":"User Interaction","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"user-interaction","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/legacy-type-mapping/user-interaction.html","titles":[]},"58":{"id":58,"text":"Loading data can be done in two ways, eager and Lazy.

The requirement to distribute an application over multiple processes must be solved by a clustering approach (e.g. by distributing logic AND persistent data over multiple processes or by having one process to serve as the data master for multiple worker processes).","title":"File Storage","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"file-storage","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/faq/file-storage.html","titles":[{"text":"Where does MicroStream store persistent data?","hash":"_where_does_microstream_store_persistent_data","id":1},{"text":"Can my application use more than one MicroStream instance?","hash":"_can_my_application_use_more_than_one_microstream_instance","id":2},{"text":"Is it possible to split the file-storage into many single files?","hash":"_is_it_possible_to_split_the_file_storage_into_many_single_files","id":3},{"text":"May multiple JVM processes access the same MicroStream database?","hash":"_may_multiple_jvm_processes_access_the_same_microstream_database","id":4}]},"62":{"id":62,"text":"Yes, all jars bring the necessary module-info class, in the multi-version sub-directory in the META-INF folder.

In fact, every storing of data is executed as a transaction, an atomic all-or-nothing action. When one or more entities are stored, their data is collected into a continuous block of bytes and that block is written to the physical form (the \"files\") in one fell swoop. Any problem during the IO-operation causes the whole block to be deleted (rolled back). Yes. The storing and loading process can be parallelized by using multiple threads and thus be strongly accelerated. There is no limitation on how many threads can be used, apart from the mathematical constraint that the thread count must be a power of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). Yes. There are currently two options available to create backups: An on-the-fly backup that copies and validates stored entity data after it has been written and the possibility to export all database files to a target location (which is in fact just a low-level file copying, but executed in a concurrency-safe way). Yes. MicroStream provides a per-type export of binary data and a utility to convert its binary data into the CSV format. The other way around (convert CSV to binary an import binary files) is also possible. No, because it doesn’t need to. Such concerns are long covered by the application itself, with the DBMS usually being degraded to only being the application’s exclusive database. Thus, all that is needed for a modern business application is just an application-exclusive data storage solution, which is exactly what MicroStream is. Yes, if the data is structured in a format conforming to the entity classes and with references being represented in globally unique and bijective numbers. How hard that is for a given database depends on its specifics, but it can be as easy as executing one generically created SELECT per table.

A value⇐0 disables verification. max-check-retries Set the number of times the client will attempt to check status for the execution of an asynchronous data definition or administrative statement execution in the face of network connection problems. network-roundtrip-timeout Configures the amount of time to allow for a single round-trip network communication with the server. This value is added to the request timeout to determine the total amount of time that the client should wait for a request to complete before timing out. read-zones Comma separated lists of zones in which nodes must be located to be used for read operations. If the argument is null, or this method has not been called, then read operations can be performed on nodes in any zone. registry-open-timeout Configures the connect/open timeout used when making RMI registry lookup requests. registry-read-timeout Configures the read timeout associated with sockets used to make RMI registry requests. Shorter timeouts result in more rapid failure detection and recovery. However, this timeout should be sufficiently long so as to allow for the longest timeout associated with a request. request-timeout Configures the default request timeout. sg-attrs-cache-timeout Sets the timeout of cached sequence generator attributes in milliseconds. socket-open-timeout Configures the open timeout used when establishing sockets used to make client requests.

When called, the reference held in the Lazy Reference is removed and only the ID is kept so that the instance can be reloaded when needed. Important background knowledge: However, such a clear does not mean that the referenced instance immediately disappears from memory. That’s the job of the garbage collector of the JVM. The reference is even registered in another place, namely in a global directory (Swizzle Registry), in which each known instance is registered with its ObjectId in a bijective manner. This means: if you clear such a reference, but shortly thereafter the Lazy Reference is queried again, probably nothing has to be loaded from the database, but simply the reference from the Swizzle Registry is restored. Nevertheless, the Swizzle Registry is not a memory leak, because it references the instances only via WeakReference. In short, if an instance is only referenced as \"weak,\" the JVM GC will still clean it up. So that the Lazy References do not have to be managed manually, but the whole goes automatically, there is the following mechanism: Each Lazy instance has a lastTouched timestamp. Each .get() call sets it to the current time. This will tell you how long a Lazy Reference has not been used, i.e. if it is needed at all. The LazyReferenceManager audits this. It is enabled by default, with a timeout of 1,000,000 milliseconds, which is about 15 minutes. A custom manager can be set easily, which should happen before a storage is started. LazyReferenceManager.set(LazyReferenceManager.New( Lazy.Checker( Duration.ofMinutes(30).toMillis(), // timeout of lazy access 0.75 // memory quota ) ); The timeout of lazy references is set to 30 minutes, meaning references which haven’t been touched for this time are cleared.

Of course, it’s not really about the technical implementation of procrastination, but about efficiency: why bloat the limited RAM with stuff before you even need it? Classic example: The application has self-contained data areas that contain a large amount of data. The data for an area is not loaded if the area is not worked at all. Instead, you only load a tiny amount of \"head data\" for each area (name or other for displaying purposes) and the actual data only when the application really needs it. E.g. fiscal years with hundreds of thousands or millions of sales. One million revenue records for 2010, one million for 2011, for 2012, etc. In 2019, most of the time only 2019 and 2018 will be needed. The previous few, and the year 2000 sales are not of great interest anymore. Therefore: load data only when needed. Super efficient. For example let’s say the app \"MyBusinessApp\" has a root instance class, looking like this: public class MyBusinessApp { // ... private HashMap businessYears = new HashMap<>(); // ... } The business year hold the turnovers: public class BusinessYear { // ... private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); // ... } This approach would be a problem: During initialization, the root instance would be loaded, from there its HashMap with all BusinessYear instances, each with its ArrayList and thus all conversions. For all years. 20 years of approximately 1 million sales makes 20 million entities, which are pumped directly into the RAM at the start. It does not matter if someone needs it or not. We don’t want it that way. It would be nice if you could simply add a \"lazy\" to the turnover list. And that’s exactly how it works: public class BusinessYear { // ... private Lazy> turnovers = ...; // we will get to that // ... } And bingo, the turnovers are now loaded lazily. Of course, this is no longer an ArrayList field, which is now magically loaded lazy, but this is now a Lazy field and the instances of this type are typed generically to ArrayList . Lazy is just a simple class whose instances internally hold an ID and a reference to the actual thing (here the ArrayList instance). If the internal reference is zero, the reserved ID is used to reload it. If it is not null, it is simply returned. So just a reference intermediate instance. Similar to the JDK’s WeakReference, just not JVM-weak, but storage-lazy. What do you have to do now to get the actual ArrayList instance? ArrayList turnovers = this.turnovers.get(); Just as with WeakReference, or simply as one would expect from a reference intermediate type in general: a simple get method. The .get() call reloads the data as needed. But you do not want to mess around with that yourself. No \"SELECT bla FROM turnovers WHERE ID =\" + this.turnovers.getId(). Since you want to program your application you don' t have to mess around with low-level database ID-loading stuff. That’s what the MicroStream Code does internally. You do not even need to access the ID, you just have to say \"get!\". That’s it. There are different strategies, what you write here. Analogous to the code example before it would be simply: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(new ArrayList<>()); So always a new ArrayList instance, wrapped in a Lazy instance. If the actual ArrayList reference should be null at first, it works the same way: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(null); The this.turnovers.get() also just always returns null. Completely transparent. But you could also do this: private Lazy> turnovers = null; If there is no list, then you do not make any intermediate reference instance for any list. A separate instance for null is indeed a bit …​ meh. But that has a nasty problem elsewhere: this.turnovers.get() does not work then. Because NullPointerException. Anytime you need to write this here, the readability of code is not exactly conducive: return this.turnovers == null ? null : this.turnovers.get(); But there is a simple solution: Just move this check into a static utility method. Just like that: return Lazy.get(this.turnovers); This is the same .get(), just with a static null-check around it. This always puts you on the safe side. For Lazy Loading, simply wrap Lazy<> around the actual field and then call .get() or maybe better Lazy.get(...). It’s as simple as that. The full example can be found on GitHub. Why do you have to replace your actual instance with a lazy loading intermediate instance and fiddle around with generics? Why is not something like this: @Lazy private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); Put simply: If it were just that it would be bare Java bytecode for accessing an ArrayList. There would be no way for a middleware library to get access and look it up and perhaps reload it. What’s written there is an ArrayList reference. There is no lazy anymore. Either, the instance is null, or it is not null. If you wanted to reach in there, you would have to start with bytecode manipulation. Technically possible, but something you really don’t want in your application. So there must always be some form of intermediary. Hibernate solves this through its own collection implementations that do lazy loading internally. Although the lazy loading is nicely hidden in some way (or not, if you need an annotation for that), it also comes with all sorts of limitations. You can only use interfaces instead of concrete classes for collections. At first, the instance is not the one you dictate, the code becomes non-transparent and difficult to debug, you have to use a collection, even if it’s just a single instance, and so on. You want to be able to write anything you want and you want full insight and control (debugability, etc.) over the code. All this can be done with the tiny Lazy Interim Reference class. No restrictions, no incomprehensible \"magic\" under the hood (proxy instances and stuff) and also usable for individual instances.","title":"Lazy Loading","component":"manual","version":"5.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/5.0/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What about the \"…​\" ?","hash":"_what_about_the","id":1},{"text":"In Short","hash":"_in_short","id":2},{"text":"Side Note","hash":"_side_note","id":3}]},"83":{"id":83,"text":"For convenience MicroStream provides Null-safe static access methods for lazy references.

JCache standardizes caching for the Java platform. It provides a common mechanism to cache values in a map-like structure. It expedites the mainstream adoption of in-memory computing by giving all Java developers an easy way to access memory from within Java. Businesses can change providers without rewriting their applications or maintaining a proprietary cache abstraction layer. This caching standard is used in a wide variety of environments. The most common use cases are: Second-level cache in JPA (e.g. Hibernate) Spring Cache Abstraction and many more Why another JCache implementation, you may wonder. There is already a myriad of providers out there. MicroStream’s very own serialization and storage can be utilized to get the best out of caches. For example you are not limited to java.io.Serializable types, when storing by value. That means every key-value pair gets copied every time you put and get entries in and out of a cache. And if a cache is used with a backing store, MicroStream’s storage can be used to get the best possible performance. And now, MicroStream being a JCache provider, you can use it as a drop-in replacement in your existing application. The caching provider represents the implementation of JCache that you are using. You can use more than one JCache implementation in your project if you wish, and CachingProvider is how you access the different providers that are in use. It is responsible for managing and providing access to many named caches. The cache holds the different values being cached. You can have several caches, each of which may be holding data for a different purpose. Each one can have a different configuration; for example, different caches may evict old data using different techniques. Each item of data in a cache is an entry, which is a key-value pair. The key is a unique value used to store and look up the data. The value is the actual data you wish to cache. Caches have some different properties than Maps, but the calls that you would use to store and lookup data is very similar.","title":"Cache","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/6.0/cache/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","hash":"_motivation","id":1},{"text":"Basic Concepts of JCache","hash":"_basic_concepts_of_jcache","id":2},{"text":"CachingProvider","hash":"_cachingprovider","id":3},{"text":"CacheManager","hash":"_cachemanager","id":4},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":5},{"text":"Entry","hash":"_entry","id":6}]},"86":{"id":86,"text":"Bugfix release.

Bugfix release for projects using an old non public version. Fixed bug in type dictionary parser for old legacy type handlers Added a convenience layer for defining custom type handlers Fully automatic lazy reference managing for clearing older Lazy references as free memory gets lower. Completed optimized persistence handling for remaining types in JDK that are reasonable to appear in entity graphs. E.g.

Removed unnecessary memory consumption exponential to channel count. Improved exception messages on invalid configuration values (file sizes etc.) Workarounded a JDK bug regarding file locking when importing files (JDK exception says another process is locking the file which is outright wrong) Fixed type resolving problems when different ClassLoaders are involved. Fixed a bug that caused loading of zero-length arrays to throw an exception despite everything being fine. Various smaller bugfixes for unnecessary exceptions in special cases and state robustness after exceptions. From 2.2 no actions are necessary, for older versions see below. Removed SelfStoring without replacement since it could not be used recursively and has no advantages over just creating a static storing utility method for a certain entity. Added state validation of value type objects (e.g. String, Integer, BigDecimal, etc.) upon loading. This is hardly relevant in practice, but not having it can lead to confusing hello-world-like test applications. EmbeddedStorageManager now implements java.lang.AutoClosable. Replaced all provisional RuntimeExceptions with either PersistenceException or StorageException, depending on the architectural level the corresponding source code it located. The two technically different root handling concepts (\"default\" and \"custom\") have been consolidated in a way that they are the same thing on the API level and interchangeable, meaning no more confusion with those root exception messages. All entity fields of type transient EmbeddedStorageManager now get a reference to the used EmbeddedStorageManager instance set upon loading/updating. The interfaces around storage managing have been enhanced so that it is now equally valid to just write StorageManager instead of EmbeddedStorageManager. (An EmbeddedStorageManager \"is a\" StorageManager) Slight technical consolidation of Lazy reference handling caused the type Lazy to be moved from the package one.microstream.persistence.lazy to one.microstream.reference. The reason is that the lazy handling has actually no inherent connection to persistence or storage. It’s actually just a generic concept that can be used by those layers. See Migration Guide below on how to adjust existing projects. Fixed an off-heap memory leak when restarting the storage multiple times in the same process. Fixed a bug where changing the fields of an entity type caused an exception. This was a regression bug from fixing a similar problem for another case in version 2.1. Now, both cases work correctly. All occurrences in user code of one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy have to be refactored to one.microstream.reference.Lazy. Modern IDEs provide a functionality to \"auto-import\" missing types or automatically \"organize imports\", so this should be resolved with a proverbial push of a button. Android support MicroStream is now Java-wise fully compatible with Android. Replaced all usages of java.util.File with java.nio.file.Path to allow using custom file implementations. Improved skipping functionality of Storers (see EmbeddedStorageManager#createStorer and Storer#skip). The class Lazy is now an interface to allow custom implementations. See Migration guide below. Fixed a few minor bugs in the skipping functionality of Storers. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after the storage was shut down. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after an exception in storage initialization. Enums defining an abstract method are now handled correctly. By default, all threads created by MicroStream now start with the prefix \"MicroStream-\". This can be customized by the new interface StorageThreadNameProvider. Fixed a NullPointerException in import. Fixed a bug that caused enums with a certain field layout to be loaded inconsistently. java.util.Locale is now persisted and created using Locale’s #toLanguageTag and #forLanguageTag. In the directory of an existing storage, in the TypeDictionary file (default name \"PersistenceTypeDictionary.ptd\"), all occurrences of \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy\" must be replaced with \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy$Default\".","title":"Changelog","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"changelog","url":"/manual/6.0/intro/changelog.html","titles":[{"text":"6.1","hash":"_6_1","id":1},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes","id":2},{"text":"6.0","hash":"_6_0","id":3},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features","id":4},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_2","id":5},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide","id":6},{"text":"5.0.2","hash":"_5_0_2","id":7},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_3","id":8},{"text":"5.0.1","hash":"_5_0_1","id":9},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_4","id":10},{"text":"5.0","hash":"_5_0","id":11},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_2","id":12},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_5","id":13},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"5_0_migration-guide","id":14},{"text":"Artifacts and Packages","hash":"_artifacts_and_packages","id":15},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":16},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":17},{"text":"Storage","hash":"_storage","id":18},{"text":"4.1","hash":"_4_1","id":19},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_3","id":20},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_6","id":21},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"4_1_migration-guide","id":22},{"text":"4.0","hash":"_4_0","id":23},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_4","id":24},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_7","id":25},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"4_0_migration-guide","id":26},{"text":"3.0.1","hash":"_3_0_1","id":27},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_8","id":28},{"text":"3.0","hash":"_3_0","id":29},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_5","id":30},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_9","id":31},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"3_0_migration-guide","id":32},{"text":"2.2","hash":"_2_2","id":33},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_6","id":34},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_10","id":35},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"2_2_migration-guide","id":36},{"text":"2.1","hash":"_2_1","id":37},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_7","id":38},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_11","id":39},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"_migration_guide_2","id":40}]},"87":{"id":87,"text":"You can find the MicroStream libraries in the Maven Central repository.

But the managing thread accessing it can. When an EmbeddedStorageManager is \"started\" it is actually just setup with all kinds of default and user-defined settings and definitions. What is actually \"started\" are the database managing threads that process storing and loading requests. // Setup the database manager and start the managing threads EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); Of course, for every start() method, there needs to be something like a shutdown() method. So there is in MicroStream: // Stop accessing the database storageManager.shutdown(); But is it really necessary to call shutdown? Should it be? What if there’s an error and the process stops without calling shutdown()? Will that cause the database to become inconsistent, corrupted, maybe even destroyed? The answer is: It wouldn’t be much of a database solution if a crash could cause any problem in the persisted data. MicroStream data-store is carefully designed in such a fashion that the process it runs in can simply vanish at any point in time and the persisted data will never be corrupted. This is surprisingly simple and reliable to solve: Whenever a .store() call returns, it is guaranteed that the data stored by it has been physically written to the underlying storage layer, usually a file system. Before that, there is no guarantee regarding written data at all. In fact, should the process die before the last byte has been written and secured, the next StorageManager initialization will recognize that and truncate the last partially written store. Either way, all the data that was guaranteed to be written will be consistently available after the next .start(). As a consequence, this safety mechanism makes an explicit .shutdown() call pretty much unnecessary. It doesn’t hurt, but it is effectively more-less the same as just calling System.exit(0);. The only time when an explicit shutdown is really needed is, if the database managing threads shall be stopped but the application itself keeps running. For example, it is perfectly valid to start the StorageManager, work with the database, then stop it, maybe change some configuration or copy files or something like that and then start it up again to continue working. In any other case, the shutdown method can be ignored and the live database can happily just be \"killed\" while running. It is specifically designed to withstand such a treatment. Any live MicroStream database basically consists of three major parts: A place where the persisted data is located. Usually a file system directory. The managing threads accessing (read and write) the persisted data. The EmbeddedStorageManager instance to use and control the database in the application. Apart from a lot of internal components (configuration, processing logic, housekeeping state, etc.), that’s all there is. There is nothing special or \"magic\" about it, no static state, no global registration in the JVM process or something like that. The consequence of this is: If two EmbeddedStorageManager instances are started, each one with a different location for its persistend data, then the application has two live databases! If three or ten or 100 are started, then that’s the number of live databases the application has. There is no limit and no conflict between different databases inside the same application process. The only important thing is that no two running StorageManagers can access the same data location.","title":"Application Life-Cycle","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"application-life-cycle","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/application-life-cycle.html","titles":[{"text":"Stopping or Crashing a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_or_crashing_a_live_database","id":1},{"text":"Multiple Databases","hash":"_multiple_databases","id":2}]},"91":{"id":91,"text":"Deleting data does not require performing explicit deleting actions like DELETE FROM table WHERE…​.

In line 6 the current storage’s content is printed. Line 7 assigns some data to the storage, replacing existing data if there is some. In line 8 everything gets stored. When using MicroStream, your entire database is accessed starting at a root instance. This instance is the root object of an object graph that gets persisted by the MicroStream storage logic. While the root instance can be of any type (for example just a collection or an array), it is a good idea to define an explicit root type specific for the application. In this simple example, it is a class called DataRoot, which wraps a single String. public class DataRoot { private String content; public DataRoot() { super(); } public String getContent() { return this.content; } public void setContent(final String content) { this.content = content; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Root: \" + this.content; } } For further information, see root instances. The following code is all that is required to setup a an application backed by a MicroStream database. The application’s convenience root instance is defined and an EmbeddedStorageManager instance, linked to the root, is created (and its database managing threads are started). This is a fully operational Java database application. // Application-specific root instance final DataRoot root = new DataRoot(); // Initialize a storage manager (\"the database\") with the given directory. final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start( root, // root object Paths.get(\"data\") // storage directory ); // Set content data to the root element, including the time to visualize // changes on the next execution. root.setContent(\"Hello World! @ \" + new Date()); // Store the modified root and its content. storageManager.storeRoot(); This call is all that is necessary to store data in the simplest case. Best practice is to safely shutdown the storage manager by simply calling: storageManager.shutdown(); storageManager.storeRoot() is a special case method that always stores the root object. If you want to store any other object than the root itself, just call storageManager.store(modifiedObject) The full code for the Hello World example is on GitHub.","title":"Getting Started","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"getting-started","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Hello World","hash":"_hello_world","id":2},{"text":"The Root Instance","hash":"_the_root_instance","id":3},{"text":"Creating a Database","hash":"creating-a-database","id":4},{"text":"Storing Data","hash":"_storing_data","id":5},{"text":"Stopping a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_a_live_database","id":6}]},"93":{"id":93,"text":"Housekeeping is an internal background logic to optimize the database’s usage of memory and persistent storage space (typically disc space). It is comprised of mechanisms for cleaning up storage files, clearing unneeded cached data and recognizing deleted entities via garbage collection. Housekeeping is performed with a configurable time budget in configurable intervals to make sure it never interferes with the application’s work load too much (see housekeeping configuration). If new versions of an entity are stored or if entities become no longer reachable (meaning the become effectively deleted or \"garbage\" data), their older data is no longer needed. However, the byte sequences representing that old data still exist in the storage files. But since they will never be needed again, they become logical \"gaps\" in the storage files. Space that is occupied, but will never be read again. It might as well be all zeroes or not exist at all. Sadly, unwanted areas cannot simple by \"cut\" from files. Above all because that would ruin all file offsets coming after them. So with every newly stored version of an entity and every entity that is recognized as unreachable \"garbage\", a storage file consists more and more of useless \"gaps\" and less and less of actually used data. This makes the storage space less and less efficient. To prevent eventually ending up with a drive that is filled with useless bytes despite an actually not that big database, the files need to be \"cleaned up\" from time to time. To do this, the Housekeeping occasionally scans the storage files. If their \"payload\" ratio goes below the configured limit, the affected files will be retired: all data that belongs to still live entities is copied to a new file. Then the old file consists of 100% unneeded gap data and can safely be deleted. Which ratio value to set in the configuration is a matter of taste or, more precisely, depends on each individual application’s demands. A value of 1.0 (100%) means: only files with 100% payload, so no gaps at all, are acceptable. This means that for every store that contains at least one new version of an already existing entity, the corresponding storage file will contain the slightest gap, thus dropping below the demanded ratio of 100% and as a consequence, will be retired on the next occasion. This very aggressive cleanup strategy will keep the disc space usage at a perfect minimum, but at the cost of enormous amounts of copied data, since virtually every store will cause one or more storage files to be retired and their content be shifted into a new file. Respectively, a value of 0.0 (0%) means something like: \"Never care about gaps, just fill up the disc until it bursts.\" This keeps the disc write loads for the file cleanup at 0, but at the cost of rapidly eating up disc space. The best strategy most probably lies somewhere in between. Somewhere between 0.1 and 0.9 (10% and 90%). The default value is 0.75 (75%). So a storage file containing up to 25% of unused gap data is okay. Containing more gaps that 25% will cause a storage file to be retired. In addition to the payload ratio check, the file cleanup also retired files tha are too small or too big. For example: The application logic might commit a single store that is 100 MB in size. But the storage files are configured to be no larger than 10 MB (for example to keep a single file cleanup nice and fast). A single store is always written as a whole in the currently last storage file. The reason for this is to process the store as fast as possible and quickly return control to the application logic. When the housekeeping file cleanup scan encounters such an oversized file, it will retire it immediately by splitting it up across 10 smaller files and then deleting the oversized file. A similar logic applies to files that are too small. Upper and lower size bounds can be freely configured to arbitrary values. The defaults are 1 MB and 8 MB. To avoid repeated reads to storage files (which are incredibly expensive compared to just reading memory), data of once loaded entities is cached in memory. If an entity’s cached data is not requested again for a certain amount of time in relation to how much data is already cached, it is cleared from the cache to avoid unnecessarily consuming memory. The mechanism to constantly evaluate and clear cached data where applicable, is part of the housekeeping. The aggressiveness of this mechanism can be configured via the housekeeping configuration. In a reference-based (or graph-like) data paradigm, instances never have to be deleted explicitly. For example, there is no \"delete\" in the java language. There are only references. If those references are utilized correctly, deleting can be done fully automatically without any need for the developer to care about it. This is called \"garbage collection\". The concept is basically very simple: when the last reference to an instance is cut, that instance can never be accessed again. It becomes \"garbage\" that occupies memory with it data that is not needed any longer. To identify those garbage instances, all an algorithm (the \"garbage collector\") has to do is to follow every reference, starting at some defined root instance (or several) of a graph and mark every instance it encounters as \"reachable\". When it has no more unvisited instances in its queue, the marking is completed. Every instance that is not marked as reachable by then must be unreachable garbage and will be deleted from memory. Similar to the JVM’s garbage collection to optimize its memory consumption, MicroStream has a garbage collection of its own, but for the level of persistent storage space instead of memory space. However, MicroStreams multi-threaded garbage collector is currently still in development and not activated, yet. Housekeeping can also be triggered manually from the StorageConnection . Related methods are: issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, entityEvaluator) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullCacheCheck() issueFullCacheCheck(entityEvaluator) issueFullFileCheck() issueFullFileCheck(fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullGarbageCollection() issueGarbageCollection(nanoTimeBudget) All Housekeeping methods can be given a defined time budget or can be run until full completion.","title":"Housekeeping","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"housekeeping","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/housekeeping.html","titles":[{"text":"File cleanup:","hash":"_file_cleanup","id":1},{"text":"Cache cleanup","hash":"_cache_cleanup","id":2},{"text":"Garbage collection","hash":"_garbage_collection","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Housekeeping","hash":"_explicit_housekeeping","id":4}]},"94":{"id":94,"text":"MicroStream provides an API to import and export persisted data of the storage.

From a technical point of view it serves one purpose only: To fully or partially persist and restore a Java object graph in the simplest way possible for the user. MicroStream Data-Store is a storage engine, but no database management system (DBMS). Many features that typical DBMS provide have been left out on purpose. The reason is that those features exist to make a DBMS something of a server application platform of an \"old kind\" on top of its data store functionality: A standalone process with user management, connection management, session handling, often even with a programming language of its own, a querying interface (SQL), etc. Today, all of those server application features are already and much better handled by dedicated server applications (the \"new kind\"), implemented in a modern language like Java. They have their built-in user, connection and session management, the querying interface to the outside world are typically web services instead of SQL, etc. But those modern server applications still lack one important thing: an easy to use and technically efficient way to store and restore their application’s data. So a \"new kind\" server often uses an \"old kind\" server just to do the data storing. This comes at the price of catching all the overhead and problems of redundant user, connection and session management AND the outdated concepts and limitations of the old querying interface (SQL). Isn’t that very weird and frustratingly complicated? Why not simply include a modern data storing library in the modern server and be done with it? A storing library that perfectly fits the modern technology and brings in no redundant overhead or complication of a secondary outdated wannabe server process. This is exactly what MicroStream Data-Store is and the reason why it is intentionally not a DBMS but \"only\" a storage engine. One might think the easiest way to store and load data in Java would be Java’s built-in serialization. However, it turned out long ago to be very limited, making it hard, if not impossible, to be used as a replacement for a DBMS: Only complete object graphs can be stored and restored, which is unacceptable for all but very small databases. It is very inefficient in terms of storage size and performance. It does not handle changing class structures very well, basically forbidding classes of persisted entities to ever change or introducing massive manual effort to compensate. It cannot handle third-party classes that do not implement Serializable but cannot be changed. In short: The Java Serialization is not an acceptable data store solution and hence no valid replacement for those outdated DBMS. MicroStream Data-store is such a solution: It can persist, load or update object graphs partially and on-demand. It is very efficient both size- and performance-wise. It handles changing class structures by mapping data in the old structure to the current structure during loading; implicitly via internal heuristics or explicitly via a user-defined mapping strategy. It can automatically handle any Java constructs, only excluding those that are technically or reasonably not persistable (e.g. lambdas, proxies or instances with ties to JVM-internals like threads, etc.). MicroStream is what the Java Serialization should have been and it is the first and only really fitting data storing solution for modern applications, completely removing the need to attach a wannabe secondary server DBMS just to store data.","title":"Storage","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/index.html","titles":[]},"96":{"id":96,"text":"The MicroStream engine takes care of persisting your object graph.

One value after another as a trivial byte stream. References between objects are mapped with unique numbers, called ObjectId, or short OID. + With both combined, byte streams and OIDs, an object graph can be stored in a simple and quick way, as well as loaded, as a whole or partially. But there is a small catch. Where does it start? What is the first instance or reference at startup? + Strictly speaking \"nothing\". That’s why at least one instance or a reference to an instance must be registered in a special way, so that the application has a starting point from where the object graph can be loaded. This is a \"Root Instance\". Same difference, another problem are instances which are references by constant fields in Java classes. These aren’t created when the records are loaded from the database, but by the JVM while loading the classes. Without special treatment, this would be a problem: The application, meaning the JVM or the JVM process, starts, the constant instances are created by the JVM, one or more of them are stored, then the application shuts down. The stored data of the constants are now stored with a certain OID in the database. The application starts again. The Constant instances are created again by the JVM. The data records are read by MicroStream. The problem is: How should the application know what values, which are stored with a certain OID, belong to which constant? The JVM created everything from scratch at startup and doesn’t know anything about OIDs. To resolve this, the constant instances must be registered, just like the entity graph’s root instance. Then MicroStream can associate the constant instances with the stored data via the OIDs. Constant instances can be thought of as JVM-created implicit root instances for the object graph. In both cases, root and constant instances, it is about registering special starting points for the object graph in order to load it correctly. For MicroStream, from a plain technical view, both cases don’t make a difference. In the most common cases, nothing at all. The default behavior is enough to get things going. By default, a single instance can be registered as the entity graph’s root, accessible via EmbeddedStorage.root(). + Therefore, this is already a fully fledged (although tiny) database application: // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // Set the entity (graph) as root storageManager.setRoot(\"Hello World\"); // Store root storageManager.storeRoot(); If you are working with Microstream technology in a multi-threaded environment, there are a few things you need to pay extra attention to. When using standard frameworks, you often work in a multi-threaded environment. If you are using the older JDBC approach, you create a copy of your data that you work with within a single thread, modify the data, and then save it back in a database trace. Microstream works with data directly, allowing it to achieve significantly better performance parameters. However, for developers, this means that any reading and writing to this shared object graph must be synchronized. To make it easier to use within your application, we have prepared a simple way for you to do so. XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.changeData(); storageManager.store(root); }); This approach will immediately provide you with several benefits: Any changes to your object graph will be synchronized, every other thread will see the current value. Avoid Deadlocks In principle, you prevent the object graph from being modified at the same time it is saved. The simple default approach has its limits when the application defines an explicit root instance that must be updated/filled from the database directly during database initialization. Something like this: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // root must be filled at this point... but how? root.printAllMyEntities(); To solve this, a custom root instance can be directly registered at the database setup. In the simplest case, is just has to be passed to .start();: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager with a reference to the application's root. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // root is \"magically\" filled at this point. (Yay!) root.printAllMyEntities(); Internally, the two concepts (default root and custom root) and handled by different mechanisms. This can be seen from the two different methods storageManager.defaultRoot(); storageManager.customRoot(); The simplified method storageManager.root(); automatically chooses the variant that is used. Since neither of those three methods can know the concrete type of the root instance (and adding a type parameter just for that would have been a complication overkill), they all can only be typed to return Object. So, to avoid annoying and dangerous casts, it is best to keep a direct reference to a custom root instance as shown in the code snippet above. Likewise, storageManager.storeRoot(); works for both variants, so there is no need to worry about how to store which one.","title":"Root Instances","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"root-instances","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/root-instances.html","titles":[{"text":"What Must Be Done in the Application?","hash":"_what_must_be_done_in_the_application","id":1},{"text":"Shared Mutable Data","hash":"_shared_mutable_data","id":2},{"text":"Synchronize access to shared mutable data","hash":"_synchronize_access_to_shared_mutable_data","id":3},{"text":"Custom Root Instances","hash":"_custom_root_instances","id":4}]},"98":{"id":98,"text":"The default way to configure a JCache provider is to use the class javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration.

This is useful to optimize the performance for storing complex objects or in the rare case that it is not possible to store a type with the default type handlers. There are two strategies for a simplified type handler implementation. Implementing a class that extends CustomBinaryHandler and defines a sequence of BinaryFields via the #Field~ static pseudo-constructor methods. Everything else like setting the name, calculating the binary offsets, etc. is then done implicitly via reflection. Example on GitHub This example implements a custom type handler for the java.awt.image.BufferedImage class. Instead of storing the rather complex object structure of that class the image is serialized as PNG image format using javax.imageio.ImageIO into a byte array. This byte array is then stored by MicroStream. The custom type handler must be registered in the CustomTypeHandlerRegistry to enable it: EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage .Foundation(WORKINGDIR) .onConnectionFoundation(f -> f.registerCustomTypeHandlers(new CustomBufferedImageHandler()) ) .start(ROOT); Implementing a class can be skipped altogether by using the method Binary#TypeHandler and passing the BinaryFields directly. Registering such a generically created TypeHandler is not required, either, since Version 3 of MicroStream brought a solution to just define a static method in the entity class that will be recognized and used by MicroStream. The following is a simple technical example on how a custom binary handler can be easily defined and technically leveraged to optimize storage behavior.

This style of work application always works with a copy of the data. Which allows it to use mutable data only within a single thread. The developer doesn’t have to worry about data synchronization and then store this data in a database transaction. This way of working is very practical, it does not require developers to have knowledge of multithreaded programming and thanks to this it is very widespread. Can similar technical work be used when working with MicroStream? Of course, elegantly, very simply and safely we can use the ObjectCopier utility to create a deep copy of our data, change it, and save it back. Very simple idea, just create a purchase of actual data to work within the application and at the end save that data back. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. If the standard copy function is called over an object in Java, it creates a copy of that object, but the other object’s references remain the same. This doesn’t help so much. Because usually, an application contains a more complex data structure than a single object. This approach is called shallow copy. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying What is actually needed at this point is a deep copy. You need to create a complete copy of the complete subgraph from this object. MicroStream provides the full support for a deep copy. However, the following conditions must be met: Data must be already saved and manage by MicroStream. There are no circular references. The Object Graph is a Tree. (From graph theory, object graph contains no circles.) If these two above conditions are met, ObjectCopier can be relatively easily called and a deep copy of the data will be created. ObjectCopier objectCopier = ObjectCopier.New(); Customer customer = root.getCustomer(id); Customer customerCopy = objectCopier.copy(customer); customerCopy.addPurchase(purchase); XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.setCustomer(id, customerCopy); storage.store(root.getcusomers()); } What are the parts of this code? Just create an instance of ObjectCopier class due to factory method New(); Get customer Make a deep copy of the customer object Modify this object graph In synchronized mode save this customer instead of the original customer and save it into a datastore This simple example written in pseudocode aims to demonstrate one of the many ways to solve working over a shared object graph in a multi-threaded environment.","title":"Use Data Copy","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"deep-copy","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/storing-data/deep-copy.html","titles":[{"text":"Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy","hash":"_deep_copy_vs_shallow_copy","id":1},{"text":"Deep Copy Utility (ObjectCopier)","hash":"_deep_copy_utility_objectcopier","id":2}]},"117":{"id":117,"text":"MicroStream is designed to work with object graphs. Thus, storing data means to store an object graph. This includes the object’s value fields and references to other objects. Storing an object will also store all instances referenced by this objects that have not been stored before. While storing your data most of the work MicroStream performs for you. You only need to call the store method on the correct object. The rule is: \"The Object that has been modified has to be stored!\". Storing objects that are not part of an object graph is most likely pointless. See Getting Started how to create a database with a root instance. To store the registered root instance just call the storeRoot() method of a EmbeddedStorageManager instance. // Init storage manager final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // Store the root object storageManager.storeRoot(); To store a newly created object, store the \"owner\" of the object. In the example below a new object is created and added to the myObjects list of the root object. Then the modified list gets stored. This will also store the new object. // Add a new data object to the list in root MyData dataItem = new MyData(\"Alice\"); root.myObjects.add(dataItem); // Store the modified list storageManager.store(root.myObjects); Before storing a modified object keep in your mind that the modified object needs to be stored. In case of a value types, like int, it is the object that has the int field as a member: // Modify a value type memeber and store it dataItem.setIntValue(100); storageManager.store(dataItem); Don’t forget immutable objects Immutable objects like String cannot be modified. Assigning a new value to a String does not modify the String object. Instead a new String instance is created and the reference is changed! // Change a string object and store it dataItem.setName(\"Bob\"); storageManager.store(dataItem); The full code for the example is on GitHub.","title":"Storing Data","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/storing-data/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Storing Root Instances","hash":"_storing_root_instances","id":1},{"text":"Storing New Objects","hash":"_storing_new_objects","id":2},{"text":"Storing Modified Objects","hash":"_storing_modified_objects","id":3}]},"118":{"id":118,"text":"The MicroStream engine supports two general storing strategies: lazy and eager storing. By default, MicroStream uses the lazy storing strategy. These storing strategies differ in the way how objects, referenced by the object to be stored are handled if those referenced objects had already been stored.

If a referenced instance has been stored previously it is not stored again even if it has been modified. That’s why modified objects must be stored explicitly. In eager storing mode referenced instances are stored even if they had been stored before. Contrary to Lazy storing this will also store modified child objects at the cost of performance. To use lazy or eager storing explicitly, get an instance of the required Storer and use it’s store methods: Storer storer = storage.createEagerStorer(); storer.store(myData); storer.commit(); Available Storers are: storage.createLazyStorer() storage.createEagerStorer() Standard storing: storage.createStorer() will provide corresponding Storer instances.

All types in the public API are, whenever possible, interfaces. This offers the best possibilities to extend or exchange parts of the engine. A good ways to enrich a type with features, is the wrapper (decorator) pattern. For example, let’s say we want to add logging to the PersistenceStoring's store(object) method. PersistenceStoring.java public interface PersistenceStoring { public long store(Object instance); public long[] storeAll(Object... instances); public void storeAll(Iterable instances); public void storeSelfStoring(SelfStoring storing); } Conventionally it would be done that way: A new type, implementing the original interface, would be handed over the wrapped instance, all interface methods have to be implemented and delegated. And in the single method, we wanted to add functionality; the actual implementation of the logging is done. public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } This produces a lot of overhead. In this case, three methods are just boilerplate code to delegate the calls to the wrapped instance. A common solution for that is to create an abstract base wrapper type for the designated interface, and to reuse it whenever needed. public abstract class BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } And then, based on that, the implementation of the logger type would look like this: public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging extends BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring { public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(wrapped); } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return super.store(instance); } } That’s better. No more boilerplate code. Just overwrite the methods you want to extend. The only work left is, to generate the base wrapper types. One way is to let your IDE generate the wrapper or delegation code. Disadvantage of that is, it has to be redone every time your interfaces change. A code generator, which does it automatically would be nice. And that’s what the base module brings along. Like the layered entity code generator, it is an annotation processor.","title":"Wrapping","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/6.0/misc/wrapping/index.html","titles":[]},"133":{"id":133,"text":"MicroStream’s wrapper code generator generates following wrapper type for PersistenceStoring: public interface WrapperPersistenceStoring extends Wrapper, PersistenceStoring { @Override public default long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped().store(instance); } @Override public default long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped().storeAll(instances); } @Override public default void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped().storeAll(instances); } @Override public default void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped().storeSelfStoring(storing); } } It is not an abstract class, but an interface, which extends the Wrapper interface of the microstream-base module, and the wrapped type itself. This offers you the most flexible way to use it in your application. The Wrapper type is just a typed interface and an abstract implementation of itself. Wrapper.java public interface Wrapper { public W wrapped(); public abstract class Abstract implements Wrapper { private final W wrapped; protected Abstract(final W wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public final W wrapped() { return this.wrapped; } } } You can either implement the Wrapper interface and provide the wrapped instance via the wrapped() method, or you can extend the abstract class and hand over the wrapped instance to the super constructor.

Contact.java (old) public class Contact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; } Contact.java (new) public class Contact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNode ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } Console Output ---------- Legacy type mapping required for legacy type 1000055:Contact to current type 1000056:Contact Fields: java.lang.String Contact#firstname -1.000 ----> java.lang.String Contact#firstname java.lang.String Contact#name -0.750 ----> java.lang.String Contact#lastname java.lang.String Contact#email -0.708 ----> java.lang.String Contact#emailAddress java.lang.String Contact#note -0.636 ----> java.lang.String Contact#supportNode [***new***] PostalAddress Contact#postalAddress int Contact#age -1.000 ----> int Contact#age java.lang.Object Contact#link [discarded] --- Write 'y' to accept the mapping. The fields in the Contact entity class have been renamed, reordered, one was removed, one is new. What the heuristic is doing now is something like this: String firstname is equal in both classes, so it has to be the same, pretty much as int age. name and lastname is pretty similar, type is the same too. If there is nothing better for the two, they probably belong together. Same with the other two fields. In the end, the ominous link and postalAddress remain. The heuristic can not make sense of that, so it assumes that one thing falls away and the other one is added. In this particular example, that worked perfectly. Well done, heuristic. But: Just as people can make mistakes in estimating similarities (\"I would have thought …​\"), even programs can make mistakes as soon as they logically go on thin ice. There is nothing more with absolute correctness that you actually know from (bug-free) software. Such a similarity matching will be correct in the most cases, but sometimes it will also fall by the wayside. Example: perhaps only PostalAddress instances were referenced in the application under link and the two fields would actually be the same, only now properly typed and named. How should heuristics know that? Nobody could know that either, if he is not privy to the details of the concrete application. That’s why Legacy Type Mapping has two mechanisms that prevent things from going wrong: A callback interface is used to create the desired mapping result: PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor Optionally, an explicit mapping can be specified, which is then preferred to the heuristic approach. If you do not want that, you can simply set another resultor. Like in this example each suspected mapping is submitted once to the user for control in the console. This is done with the InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor. Maybe even one, where the user can \"rewire\" the mapping itself, write out the mapping, and then return an appropriate result. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(myDataDir); foundation.getConnectionFoundation().setLegacyTypeMappingResultor( InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() ) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(myRoot).start(); All you need is two columns of strings: from old to new. By default MicroStream uses a CSV file, but you can also write something else. In the end, a lot of string pairs for \"old → new\" mappings have to come into the program somewhere. The concept is simple: If there are two strings, this is interpreted as a mapping from an old thing to a new thing. If the second value is missing, it is interpreted as an old thing to be deleted. Missing the first value, then it’s as a new thing. Why call it \"thing\"? Because this applies to several structural elements: Constant identifier Class names Field names Example: count; articleCount means: the field named earlier count is called articleCount in the current version of the class. count; means: the early field count should be ignored during the mapping. More specifically, the values ​​of this field per record. ;articleCount means, this is a newly added field, DO NOT try to match it with anything else heuristically. You can also mix explicit mapping and heuristics. Only explicitly specify so many changes until the analysis gets the rest right by itself. That means you never have to specify the annoying trivial cases explicitly. Only the tricky ones. Usually, nothing should be necessary at all, or maybe a view indications at most to avoid mishaps. However, those who strictly prefer to make any change explicitly, instead of trusting a \"guessing\" software, can also do that. No problem. For class names, the three variants map, add and remove are somewhat tricky in meaning: Map is just old → new, same as with fields. To make an entry for a new class doesn’t make sense. It’s covered by the new class itself. You can do it, but it has no effect. Marking a removed class as deleted makes no sense either, except one special case. It is not required to specify the fields mapping of mapped classes if the mapping heuristic can do a correct field mapping. Especially if classes have been renamed only. Classes are simply referred to by their full qualified class name: com.my.app.entities.Order In some cases you need to specify the exact Version of the class, then the TypeId has to be prepended: 1012345:com.my.app.entities.Order Mapping from old to new: com.my.app.entities.Order;com.my.app.entities.OrderImplementation For fields it’s a bit more complex. To unambiguously refer a field, the full qualified name of its defining class has to be used. com.my.app.entities.Order#count;com.my.app.entities.Order#articleCount The # is based on official Java syntax, like e.g. in JavaDoc. If inheritance is involved, which must be uniquely resolved (each class in the hierarchy can have a field named \"count\"), you must also specify the declaring class. Like this: com.my.app.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#count; ⤦ com.my.App.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#articleCount A simple example: OldContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class OldContact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; // to be discarded } NewContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class NewContact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNote ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } refactorings.csv old current com.my.app.entities.OldContact com.my.app.entities.NewContact com.my.app.entities.OldContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.NewContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#name com.my.app.entities.NewContact#lastname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#email com.my.app.entities.NewContact#emailAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#note com.my.app.entities.NewContact#supportNote com.my.app.entities.NewContact#postalAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#age com.my.app.entities.NewContact#age com.my.app.entities.OldContact#link EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(dataDir); foundation.setRefactoringMappingProvider( Persistence.RefactoringMapping(Paths.get(\"refactorings.csv\")) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(root).start(); So far so good, all classes and fields are getting mapped, automatically or manually. But what about the data? How are the values getting transformed from old to new? Technically speaking it’s done fully automatic. But there are some interesting questions: What if the primitive types changes? What if primitives change to references and vice versa? How fast is it? Let’s say int to float. Just to copy the four bytes would yield wrong results. It has to be converted, like float floatValue = (float)intValue; Can it be done? Yes, fully automatic. The class BinaryValueTranslators does the job for you, it has a converter function from each primitive to another. Currently MicroStream supports conversion between primitives and their wrapper types, and vice versa. When converting a wrapper to a primitive, null is converted to 0. If you need special conversions between object types, you can add custom BinaryValueSetter for that, see customizing. How fast is that? The type analysis happens only once during initialization. If no exception occurs, the Legacy Type Mapping is ready-configured for each necessary type and will then only be called if required. For normal entity classes that are parsed by reflection, legacy type mapping loading is just as fast as a normal load. An array of such value translator functions is put together once and they are run through each time they are loaded. With legacy mapping, only the order and the target offsets are different, but the principle is the same as with normal loading. For custom handlers an intermediate step is necessary: ​​First put all the old values ​​together in an order that the custom handler expects and then read the binary data normally, as if loading a record in the current format. That’s necessary because MicroStream can’t know what such a custom handler does internally. If someone ever uses such a custom handler, the small detour is not likely to be noticeable in terms of performance. And if it should be the case and it has a negative effect on the productive operation: No problem, because: Of course you can also write a custom legacy type handler. It would run at full speed even with tricky special cases. Of course there is the possibility, as always, of intervening in the machinery massively with customizing. If you need the highest possible performance for some cases, or for logging / debugging, or anyway: Register any value translator implementations. In the simplest case this is 1 line of code, so do not worry. Being able to specify refactoring mapping in a different way than a CSV file is another example. You can even customize (extend or replace) the strategy that is looked up in refactoring mapping. Furthermore, you can also replace the heuristic logic with your own. This is easier than it sounds. This is just a primitive little interface (PersistenceMemberSimilator) and the default implementation thereof calls e.g. just a Levenshtein algorithm for names. You can certainly do that 10 times more clever. Or \"more appropriate\" for a particular application or programming style. E.g. utilize annotations. The basic statement is: If there is a problem somewhere, whether with the heuristic or a special case request or performance problem loading a gazillion entities all at once, or if there is a need for debugging in depth or something like that: do not panic. Most likely, this is easily possible with a few lines of code. Customizing examples You can not just mark classes as deleted. As long as there are records of a certain type in the database, the corresponding class must also exist so that the instances from the database can be loaded into the application. If there are no more records, then that means that there are only a few bytes of orphaned description in the type dictionary, but nobody cares. Is it possible to delete it by hand (or rather not, there are good reasons against it) or you can just ignore it and leave it there forever. In both cases, you must not mark a class as deleted. Now the special case: In the entity graph (root instances and all recursively reachable instances from there) all references to instances of a certain type are filled in. It’s done by the application logic or possibly by a specially written script. That is, all instances of this type are unreachable. No instance is available, no instance can ever be reloaded. This means that the type is \"deleted\" from the database at the logical level. One does not have to register anywhere, that is implicitly just like that. You can actually delete the corresponding Java class from the application project because it will never be needed again during the loading process at runtime. So far so good. There is only one problem: even if the instances are never logically accessible again: the data records are still around in the database files. The initialization scans over all database files, registers all entities, collects all occurring TypeIds and ensures for every TypeId that there is a TypeHandler for it. If necessary, a LegacyTypeHandler with mapping, but still: there must be a TypeHandler for each TypeId. And a TypeHandler needs a runtime type. That is, ass-backwards, over records that are logically already deleted, but only physically still lying around, now it is again enforced that the erasable entity class must be present. Bummer. One can prevent this: there is a \"cleanup\" function in the database management logic, which cleans up all logical gaps in the database files (actually copies all non-gaps into a new file and thus deletes the old file altogether). You would have to call it, then all physical occurrences of the unreachable records disappear and you could easily delete the associated class. But that is annoying. That is why it makes sense for these cases - and only for them - to do the following: If you as a developer are absolutely sure that no single instance of a given class is ever reachable again, i.e. must be loaded, then you can mark a type as \"deleted\" (rather \"unreachable\") in the refactoring mapping. Then the Type Handling will create a dummy TypeHandler that does not need a runtime class. See PersistenceUnreachableTypeHandler. But be careful: if you are mistaken and an instance of such a type is still referenced somewhere and eventually loaded later at runtime, then the Unreachable handler will throw an exception. At some point during the runtime of the application, not even during initialization. The cleanup provides real security: remove all logical gaps and if then with a deleted class no more error in the initialization occurs, it is really superfluous. Any ideas, such as simply returning null in the dummy type handler instead of an instance, are a fire hazard: it may dissolve some annoying situations pleasantly, but it would also mean that existing datasets, potentially entire subgraphs, become hidden from the application. Nevertheless, the database would continue to drag them along, perhaps becoming inexplicably large, and any search for the reason would yield nothing, because the dummy type handler keeps the data records secret. Shortsighted great, but catastrophic in the long run. That’s not good. The only clean solution is: you have to know what to do with your data model. As long as there are still available instances, they must also be loadable. The annoying special case above can be defused without side effects. But it can not be more than that, otherwise it will get rid of the chaos, problems and lost confidence in the correctness of the database solution.","title":"Legacy Type Mapping","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatic Mapping","hash":"_automatic_mapping","id":1},{"text":"Explicit Mapping","hash":"_explicit_mapping","id":2},{"text":"Explicit Mapping of Classes","hash":"_explicit_mapping_of_classes","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Mapping Syntax","hash":"_explicit_mapping_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Value Conversion","hash":"_value_conversion","id":5},{"text":"Value Conversion of Primitives","hash":"value-conversion-of-primitives","id":6},{"text":"Value Conversion of References / Objects","hash":"value-conversion-of-references","id":7},{"text":"Performance","hash":"performance","id":8},{"text":"Customizing","hash":"customizing","id":9},{"text":"Special Case: Deleted Class","hash":"special-case-deleted-class","id":10}]},"144":{"id":144,"text":"Here is an overview of how to enable and configure different levels of user interaction for the Legacy Type Mapping. Somewhere you have a foundation instance, a foundation in where everything is configured, from which the StorageManager is created. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(); // or from somewhere else It itself contains a foundation for connections. To access the inner thing needs a little detour. Incidentally, that’s not a JDBC connection, but this is just one thing that creates helper instances like Storer and Loader. Because Legacy Type Mapping affects loading, it has to go in there. Either you access it directly, like this: EmbeddedStorageConnectionFoundation f = foundation.getConnectionFoundation(); Or like this, that’s better for method chaining. foundation.onConnectionFoundation(f -> { ... }); If you have that, the configuration for the Legacy Type Mapping callback logic is just a one liner: f.setLegacyTypeMappingResultor(...); Default PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() That’s just the necessary logic, without anything further. If you do not change anything, this is done by default. With Console Output PrintingLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) That wraps a printer around the necessary logic. All these storage and persistence classes are nothing sacred or super-duper intertwined or anything. These are just interfaces and if you plug in another implementation then it will be used. Inquiry InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) Resultor which asks the user to apply. More customization is possible, see below. And so on With the implementation of just one single interface method, you can build anything else you can imagine. For example, logging to a file instead of the console. Or in the personally preferred logging framework. Or write confirmed mappings into the refactorings file. Everything is possible. For the inquiring implementation (InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor) there are a few settings: When should he ask? Always or only if something is unclear. Never does not make any sense of course, then you shouldn’t use it, or alternatively the printing resultor. When is a mapping unclear? If at least one field mapping is not completely clear. A field mapping is clear if: If two fields are exactly the same (similarity 1.0 or 100%) Or if two fields are specified by the explicit mapping. So if all fields are clear according to the above rule, then there is no need to ask. And there is another special case: If a field is discarded that is not explicitly marked as discardable, then as a precaution an inquiry is always done. Although no data is lost, but the data would not be available in the application, so better ask. There are options to control this a bit finer. You can optionally specify a double as a threshold (from 0.0 to 1.0, otherwise Exception): The value determines how similar two matching fields automatically have to be so that they are not inquired. Example: The value is 0.9 (90%), but a match found is only 0.8 (80%) similar. This is according to the specification too little, there must be an inquiry as a precaution. If you specify 1.0, that means: always ask, everything is really perfectly clear. If you enter 0.0, this means: never ask or only for implicitly dropping fields. Looks like this: InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) // implicitely 1.0 InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(), 0.7) // 0.7 threshold Here a small example with a Person class. int customerid ; // -> pin String firstname ; // -> firstName String surname ; // -> lastName String comment ; // discarded, NOT new commerceId It should be changed to: Integer pin ; // firstName surname -0,688----> lastName comment -0,750----> commerceId [***new***] address customerid [discarded] customerid and pin are too different to be automatically assigned to each other. Therefore, it is wrongly assumed that customerid is omitted and pin is new. comment and commerceId are surprisingly similar (75%) and are therefore assigned. But that’s not what we want. Incidentally, it would not matter here what is defined as a threshold: customerid would be eliminated by the implicit decision. This is too delicate not to inquire, so it is always necessary to ask. To get the mapping right, you have to specify two entries: customerid is now called pin and comment should be omitted Then the inquiry looks like this: customerid -[mapped]-> pin firstname -0,944----> firstName surname -0,688----> lastName [***new***] commerceId [***new***] address comment [discarded] Due to the explicit mapping from customerid to pin, the similarity does not matter, it is the mapping that matters. To indicate this, it says \"[mapped]\" instead of the similarity. The rest is as usual. Only comment is now \"[discarded]\", according to the mapping. The difference to the above is namely: This is an explicitly predetermined absence. That does not force inquiry. This clears the way for the threshold: If you enter 0.7 or more then you will be asked. As far as everything would be clear, but the mapping of surname to lastName is below the required \"minimum similarity\", so rather ask. If you enter 0.6 or less, you will no longer be asked. Because all assignments are either explicitly specified or they are according to \"minimum similarity\" similar enough to rely on it. A recommendation for a good value for the \"minimum similarity\" is difficult. As soon as one softens rules, there is always the danger of a mistake. See comment example above: is 75% similar to commerceId. Still wrong. Then prefer 80%? Or 90%? Of course it is better, but the danger is still there. If you want to be sure, just make 1.0 or omit the parameter, then by default 1.0 is taken. The most important is the explicit mapping anyway : if \"enough\" is given by the user, there is no need to ask.","title":"User Interaction","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"user-interaction","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/legacy-type-mapping/user-interaction.html","titles":[]},"145":{"id":145,"text":"Loading data can be done in two ways, eager and Lazy.

When called, the reference held in the Lazy Reference is removed and only the ID is kept so that the instance can be reloaded when needed. Important background knowledge: However, such a clear does not mean that the referenced instance immediately disappears from memory. That’s the job of the garbage collector of the JVM. The reference is even registered in another place, namely in a global directory (Swizzle Registry), in which each known instance is registered with its ObjectId in a bijective manner. This means: if you clear such a reference, but shortly thereafter the Lazy Reference is queried again, probably nothing has to be loaded from the database, but simply the reference from the Swizzle Registry is restored. Nevertheless, the Swizzle Registry is not a memory leak, because it references the instances only via WeakReference. In short, if an instance is only referenced as \"weak,\" the JVM GC will still clean it up. So that the Lazy References do not have to be managed manually, but the whole goes automatically, there is the following mechanism: Each Lazy instance has a lastTouched timestamp. Each .get() call sets it to the current time. This will tell you how long a Lazy Reference has not been used, i.e. if it is needed at all. The LazyReferenceManager audits this.

Of course, it’s not really about the technical implementation of procrastination, but about efficiency: why bloat the limited RAM with stuff before you even need it? Classic example: The application has self-contained data areas that contain a large amount of data. The data for an area is not loaded if the area is not worked at all. Instead, you only load a tiny amount of \"head data\" for each area (name or other for displaying purposes) and the actual data only when the application really needs it. E.g. fiscal years with hundreds of thousands or millions of sales. One million revenue records for 2010, one million for 2011, for 2012, etc. In 2019, most of the time only 2019 and 2018 will be needed. The previous few, and the year 2000 sales are not of great interest anymore. Therefore: load data only when needed. Super efficient. For example let’s say the app \"MyBusinessApp\" has a root instance class, looking like this: public class MyBusinessApp { // ... private HashMap businessYears = new HashMap<>(); // ... } The business year hold the turnovers: public class BusinessYear { // ... private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); // ... } This approach would be a problem: During initialization, the root instance would be loaded, from there its HashMap with all BusinessYear instances, each with its ArrayList and thus all conversions. For all years. 20 years of approximately 1 million sales makes 20 million entities, which are pumped directly into the RAM at the start. It does not matter if someone needs it or not. We don’t want it that way. It would be nice if you could simply add a \"lazy\" to the turnover list. And that’s exactly how it works: public class BusinessYear { // ... private Lazy> turnovers = ...; // we will get to that // ... } And bingo, the turnovers are now loaded lazily. Of course, this is no longer an ArrayList field, which is now magically loaded lazy, but this is now a Lazy field and the instances of this type are typed generically to ArrayList . Lazy is just a simple class whose instances internally hold an ID and a reference to the actual thing (here the ArrayList instance). If the internal reference is zero, the reserved ID is used to reload it. If it is not null, it is simply returned. So just a reference intermediate instance. Similar to the JDK’s WeakReference, just not JVM-weak, but storage-lazy. What do you have to do now to get the actual ArrayList instance? ArrayList turnovers = this.turnovers.get(); Just as with WeakReference, or simply as one would expect from a reference intermediate type in general: a simple get method. The .get() call reloads the data as needed. But you do not want to mess around with that yourself. No \"SELECT bla FROM turnovers WHERE ID =\" + this.turnovers.getId(). Since you want to program your application you don' t have to mess around with low-level database ID-loading stuff. That’s what the MicroStream Code does internally. You do not even need to access the ID, you just have to say \"get!\". That’s it. There are different strategies, what you write here. Analogous to the code example before it would be simply: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(new ArrayList<>()); So always a new ArrayList instance, wrapped in a Lazy instance. If the actual ArrayList reference should be null at first, it works the same way: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(null); The this.turnovers.get() also just always returns null. Completely transparent. But you could also do this: private Lazy> turnovers = null; If there is no list, then you do not make any intermediate reference instance for any list. A separate instance for null is indeed a bit …​ meh. But that has a nasty problem elsewhere: this.turnovers.get() does not work then. Because NullPointerException. Anytime you need to write this here, the readability of code is not exactly conducive: return this.turnovers == null ? null : this.turnovers.get(); But there is a simple solution: Just move this check into a static utility method. Just like that: return Lazy.get(this.turnovers); This is the same .get(), just with a static null-check around it. This always puts you on the safe side. For Lazy Loading, simply wrap Lazy<> around the actual field and then call .get() or maybe better Lazy.get(...). It’s as simple as that. The full example can be found on GitHub. Why do you have to replace your actual instance with a lazy loading intermediate instance and fiddle around with generics? Why is not something like this: @Lazy private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); Put simply: If it were just that it would be bare Java bytecode for accessing an ArrayList. There would be no way for a middleware library to get access and look it up and perhaps reload it. What’s written there is an ArrayList reference. There is no lazy anymore. Either, the instance is null, or it is not null. If you wanted to reach in there, you would have to start with bytecode manipulation. Technically possible, but something you really don’t want in your application. So there must always be some form of intermediary. Hibernate solves this through its own collection implementations that do lazy loading internally. Although the lazy loading is nicely hidden in some way (or not, if you need an annotation for that), it also comes with all sorts of limitations. You can only use interfaces instead of concrete classes for collections. At first, the instance is not the one you dictate, the code becomes non-transparent and difficult to debug, you have to use a collection, even if it’s just a single instance, and so on. You want to be able to write anything you want and you want full insight and control (debugability, etc.) over the code. All this can be done with the tiny Lazy Interim Reference class. No restrictions, no incomprehensible \"magic\" under the hood (proxy instances and stuff) and also usable for individual instances.","title":"Lazy Loading","component":"manual","version":"6.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/6.0/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What about the \"…​\" ?","hash":"_what_about_the","id":1},{"text":"In Short","hash":"_in_short","id":2},{"text":"Side Note","hash":"_side_note","id":3}]},"170":{"id":170,"text":"For convenience MicroStream provides Null-safe static access methods for lazy references.

But the managing thread accessing it can. When an EmbeddedStorageManager is \"started\" it is actually just setup with all kinds of default and user-defined settings and definitions. What is actually \"started\" are the database managing threads that process storing and loading requests. // Setup the database manager and start the managing threads EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); Of course, for every start() method, there needs to be something like a shutdown() method. So there is in MicroStream: // Stop accessing the database storageManager.shutdown(); But is it really necessary to call shutdown? Should it be? What if there’s an error and the process stops without calling shutdown()? Will that cause the database to become inconsistent, corrupted, maybe even destroyed? The answer is: It wouldn’t be much of a database solution if a crash could cause any problem in the persisted data. MicroStream data-store is carefully designed in such a fashion that the process it runs in can simply vanish at any point in time and the persisted data will never be corrupted. This is surprisingly simple and reliable to solve: Whenever a .store() call returns, it is guaranteed that the data stored by it has been physically written to the underlying storage layer, usually a file system. Before that, there is no guarantee regarding written data at all. In fact, should the process die before the last byte has been written and secured, the next StorageManager initialization will recognize that and truncate the last partially written store. Either way, all the data that was guaranteed to be written will be consistently available after the next .start(). As a consequence, this safety mechanism makes an explicit .shutdown() call pretty much unnecessary. It doesn’t hurt, but it is effectively more-less the same as just calling System.exit(0);. The only time when an explicit shutdown is really needed is, if the database managing threads shall be stopped but the application itself keeps running. For example, it is perfectly valid to start the StorageManager, work with the database, then stop it, maybe change some configuration or copy files or something like that and then start it up again to continue working. In any other case, the shutdown method can be ignored and the live database can happily just be \"killed\" while running. It is specifically designed to withstand such a treatment. Any live MicroStream database basically consists of three major parts: A place where the persisted data is located. Usually a file system directory. The managing threads accessing (read and write) the persisted data. The EmbeddedStorageManager instance to use and control the database in the application. Apart from a lot of internal components (configuration, processing logic, housekeeping state, etc.), that’s all there is. There is nothing special or \"magic\" about it, no static state, no global registration in the JVM process or something like that. The consequence of this is: If two EmbeddedStorageManager instances are started, each one with a different location for its persistend data, then the application has two live databases! If three or ten or 100 are started, then that’s the number of live databases the application has. There is no limit and no conflict between different databases inside the same application process. The only important thing is that no two running StorageManagers can access the same data location.","title":"Application Life-Cycle","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"application-life-cycle","url":"/manual/7.0/storage/application-life-cycle.html","titles":[{"text":"Stopping or Crashing a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_or_crashing_a_live_database","id":1},{"text":"Multiple Databases","hash":"_multiple_databases","id":2}]},"172":{"id":172,"text":"Deleting data does not require performing explicit deleting actions like DELETE FROM table WHERE…​.

In line 6 the current storage’s content is printed. Line 7 assigns some data to the storage, replacing existing data if there is some. In line 8 everything gets stored. When using MicroStream, your entire database is accessed starting at a root instance. This instance is the root object of an object graph that gets persisted by the MicroStream storage logic. While the root instance can be of any type (for example just a collection or an array), it is a good idea to define an explicit root type specific for the application. In this simple example, it is a class called DataRoot, which wraps a single String. public class DataRoot { private String content; public DataRoot() { super(); } public String getContent() { return this.content; } public void setContent(final String content) { this.content = content; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Root: \" + this.content; } } For further information, see root instances. The following code is all that is required to setup a an application backed by a MicroStream database. The application’s convenience root instance is defined and an EmbeddedStorageManager instance, linked to the root, is created (and its database managing threads are started). This is a fully operational Java database application. // Application-specific root instance final DataRoot root = new DataRoot(); // Initialize a storage manager (\"the database\") with the given directory. final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start( root, // root object Paths.get(\"data\") // storage directory ); // Set content data to the root element, including the time to visualize // changes on the next execution. root.setContent(\"Hello World! @ \" + new Date()); // Store the modified root and its content. storageManager.storeRoot(); This call is all that is necessary to store data in the simplest case. Best practice is to safely shutdown the storage manager by simply calling: storageManager.shutdown(); storageManager.storeRoot() is a special case method that always stores the root object. If you want to store any other object than the root itself, just call storageManager.store(modifiedObject) The full code for the Hello World example is on GitHub.","title":"Getting Started","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"getting-started","url":"/manual/7.0/storage/getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"Hello World","hash":"_hello_world","id":2},{"text":"The Root Instance","hash":"_the_root_instance","id":3},{"text":"Creating a Database","hash":"creating-a-database","id":4},{"text":"Storing Data","hash":"_storing_data","id":5},{"text":"Stopping a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_a_live_database","id":6}]},"174":{"id":174,"text":"Housekeeping is an internal background logic to optimize the database’s usage of memory and persistent storage space (typically disc space). It is comprised of mechanisms for cleaning up storage files, clearing unneeded cached data and recognizing deleted entities via garbage collection. Housekeeping is performed with a configurable time budget in configurable intervals to make sure it never interferes with the application’s work load too much (see housekeeping configuration). If new versions of an entity are stored or if entities become no longer reachable (meaning the become effectively deleted or \"garbage\" data), their older data is no longer needed. However, the byte sequences representing that old data still exist in the storage files. But since they will never be needed again, they become logical \"gaps\" in the storage files. Space that is occupied, but will never be read again. It might as well be all zeroes or not exist at all. Sadly, unwanted areas cannot simple by \"cut\" from files. Above all because that would ruin all file offsets coming after them. So with every newly stored version of an entity and every entity that is recognized as unreachable \"garbage\", a storage file consists more and more of useless \"gaps\" and less and less of actually used data. This makes the storage space less and less efficient. To prevent eventually ending up with a drive that is filled with useless bytes despite an actually not that big database, the files need to be \"cleaned up\" from time to time. To do this, the Housekeeping occasionally scans the storage files. If their \"payload\" ratio goes below the configured limit, the affected files will be retired: all data that belongs to still live entities is copied to a new file. Then the old file consists of 100% unneeded gap data and can safely be deleted. Which ratio value to set in the configuration is a matter of taste or, more precisely, depends on each individual application’s demands. A value of 1.0 (100%) means: only files with 100% payload, so no gaps at all, are acceptable. This means that for every store that contains at least one new version of an already existing entity, the corresponding storage file will contain the slightest gap, thus dropping below the demanded ratio of 100% and as a consequence, will be retired on the next occasion. This very aggressive cleanup strategy will keep the disc space usage at a perfect minimum, but at the cost of enormous amounts of copied data, since virtually every store will cause one or more storage files to be retired and their content be shifted into a new file. Respectively, a value of 0.0 (0%) means something like: \"Never care about gaps, just fill up the disc until it bursts.\" This keeps the disc write loads for the file cleanup at 0, but at the cost of rapidly eating up disc space. The best strategy most probably lies somewhere in between. Somewhere between 0.1 and 0.9 (10% and 90%). The default value is 0.75 (75%). So a storage file containing up to 25% of unused gap data is okay. Containing more gaps that 25% will cause a storage file to be retired. In addition to the payload ratio check, the file cleanup also retired files tha are too small or too big. For example: The application logic might commit a single store that is 100 MB in size. But the storage files are configured to be no larger than 10 MB (for example to keep a single file cleanup nice and fast). A single store is always written as a whole in the currently last storage file. The reason for this is to process the store as fast as possible and quickly return control to the application logic. When the housekeeping file cleanup scan encounters such an oversized file, it will retire it immediately by splitting it up across 10 smaller files and then deleting the oversized file. A similar logic applies to files that are too small. Upper and lower size bounds can be freely configured to arbitrary values. The defaults are 1 MB and 8 MB. To avoid repeated reads to storage files (which are incredibly expensive compared to just reading memory), data of once loaded entities is cached in memory. If an entity’s cached data is not requested again for a certain amount of time in relation to how much data is already cached, it is cleared from the cache to avoid unnecessarily consuming memory. The mechanism to constantly evaluate and clear cached data where applicable, is part of the housekeeping. The aggressiveness of this mechanism can be configured via the housekeeping configuration. In a reference-based (or graph-like) data paradigm, instances never have to be deleted explicitly. For example, there is no \"delete\" in the java language. There are only references. If those references are utilized correctly, deleting can be done fully automatically without any need for the developer to care about it. This is called \"garbage collection\". The concept is basically very simple: when the last reference to an instance is cut, that instance can never be accessed again. It becomes \"garbage\" that occupies memory with it data that is not needed any longer. To identify those garbage instances, all an algorithm (the \"garbage collector\") has to do is to follow every reference, starting at some defined root instance (or several) of a graph and mark every instance it encounters as \"reachable\". When it has no more unvisited instances in its queue, the marking is completed. Every instance that is not marked as reachable by then must be unreachable garbage and will be deleted from memory. Similar to the JVM’s garbage collection to optimize its memory consumption, MicroStream has a garbage collection of its own, but for the level of persistent storage space instead of memory space. Housekeeping can also be triggered manually from the StorageConnection . Related methods are: issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, entityEvaluator) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullCacheCheck() issueFullCacheCheck(entityEvaluator) issueFullFileCheck() issueFullFileCheck(fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullGarbageCollection() issueGarbageCollection(nanoTimeBudget) All Housekeeping methods can be given a defined time budget or can be run until full completion.","title":"Housekeeping","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"housekeeping","url":"/manual/7.0/storage/housekeeping.html","titles":[{"text":"File cleanup:","hash":"_file_cleanup","id":1},{"text":"Cache cleanup","hash":"_cache_cleanup","id":2},{"text":"Garbage collection","hash":"_garbage_collection","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Housekeeping","hash":"_explicit_housekeeping","id":4}]},"175":{"id":175,"text":"MicroStream provides an API to import and export persisted data of the storage.

From a technical point of view it serves one purpose only: To fully or partially persist and restore a Java object graph in the simplest way possible for the user. MicroStream Data-Store is a storage engine, but no database management system (DBMS). Many features that typical DBMS provide have been left out on purpose. The reason is that those features exist to make a DBMS something of a server application platform of an \"old kind\" on top of its data store functionality: A standalone process with user management, connection management, session handling, often even with a programming language of its own, a querying interface (SQL), etc. Today, all of those server application features are already and much better handled by dedicated server applications (the \"new kind\"), implemented in a modern language like Java. They have their built-in user, connection and session management, the querying interface to the outside world are typically web services instead of SQL, etc. But those modern server applications still lack one important thing: an easy to use and technically efficient way to store and restore their application’s data. So a \"new kind\" server often uses an \"old kind\" server just to do the data storing. This comes at the price of catching all the overhead and problems of redundant user, connection and session management AND the outdated concepts and limitations of the old querying interface (SQL). Isn’t that very weird and frustratingly complicated? Why not simply include a modern data storing library in the modern server and be done with it? A storing library that perfectly fits the modern technology and brings in no redundant overhead or complication of a secondary outdated wannabe server process. This is exactly what MicroStream Data-Store is and the reason why it is intentionally not a DBMS but \"only\" a storage engine. One might think the easiest way to store and load data in Java would be Java’s built-in serialization. However, it turned out long ago to be very limited, making it hard, if not impossible, to be used as a replacement for a DBMS: Only complete object graphs can be stored and restored, which is unacceptable for all but very small databases. It is very inefficient in terms of storage size and performance. It does not handle changing class structures very well, basically forbidding classes of persisted entities to ever change or introducing massive manual effort to compensate. It cannot handle third-party classes that do not implement Serializable but cannot be changed. In short: The Java Serialization is not an acceptable data store solution and hence no valid replacement for those outdated DBMS. MicroStream Data-store is such a solution: It can persist, load or update object graphs partially and on-demand. It is very efficient both size- and performance-wise. It handles changing class structures by mapping data in the old structure to the current structure during loading; implicitly via internal heuristics or explicitly via a user-defined mapping strategy. It can automatically handle any Java constructs, only excluding those that are technically or reasonably not persistable (e.g. lambdas, proxies or instances with ties to JVM-internals like threads, etc.).

One value after another as a trivial byte stream. References between objects are mapped with unique numbers, called ObjectId, or short OID. + With both combined, byte streams and OIDs, an object graph can be stored in a simple and quick way, as well as loaded, as a whole or partially. But there is a small catch. Where does it start? What is the first instance or reference at startup? + Strictly speaking \"nothing\". That’s why at least one instance or a reference to an instance must be registered in a special way, so that the application has a starting point from where the object graph can be loaded. This is a \"Root Instance\". Same difference, another problem are instances which are references by constant fields in Java classes. These aren’t created when the records are loaded from the database, but by the JVM while loading the classes. Without special treatment, this would be a problem: The application, meaning the JVM or the JVM process, starts, the constant instances are created by the JVM, one or more of them are stored, then the application shuts down. The stored data of the constants are now stored with a certain OID in the database. The application starts again. The Constant instances are created again by the JVM. The data records are read by MicroStream. The problem is: How should the application know what values, which are stored with a certain OID, belong to which constant? The JVM created everything from scratch at startup and doesn’t know anything about OIDs. To resolve this, the constant instances must be registered, just like the entity graph’s root instance. Then MicroStream can associate the constant instances with the stored data via the OIDs. Constant instances can be thought of as JVM-created implicit root instances for the object graph. In both cases, root and constant instances, it is about registering special starting points for the object graph in order to load it correctly. For MicroStream, from a plain technical view, both cases don’t make a difference. In the most common cases, nothing at all. The default behavior is enough to get things going. By default, a single instance can be registered as the entity graph’s root, accessible via EmbeddedStorage.root(). + Therefore, this is already a fully fledged (although tiny) database application: // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // Set the entity (graph) as root storageManager.setRoot(\"Hello World\"); // Store root storageManager.storeRoot(); If you are working with Microstream technology in a multi-threaded environment, there are a few things you need to pay extra attention to. When using standard frameworks, you often work in a multi-threaded environment. If you are using the older JDBC approach, you create a copy of your data that you work with within a single thread, modify the data, and then save it back in a database trace. Microstream works with data directly, allowing it to achieve significantly better performance parameters. However, for developers, this means that any reading and writing to this shared object graph must be synchronized. To make it easier to use within your application, we have prepared a simple way for you to do so. XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.changeData(); storageManager.store(root); }); This approach will immediately provide you with several benefits: Any changes to your object graph will be synchronized, every other thread will see the current value. Avoid Deadlocks In principle, you prevent the object graph from being modified at the same time it is saved. The simple default approach has its limits when the application defines an explicit root instance that must be updated/filled from the database directly during database initialization. Something like this: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // root must be filled at this point... but how? root.printAllMyEntities(); To solve this, a custom root instance can be directly registered at the database setup. In the simplest case, is just has to be passed to .start();: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager with a reference to the application's root. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // root is \"magically\" filled at this point. (Yay!) root.printAllMyEntities(); Internally, the two concepts (default root and custom root) and handled by different mechanisms. This can be seen from the two different methods storageManager.defaultRoot(); storageManager.customRoot(); The simplified method storageManager.root(); automatically chooses the variant that is used.

This is useful to optimize the performance for storing complex objects or in the rare case that it is not possible to store a type with the default type handlers. There are two strategies for a simplified type handler implementation. Implementing a class that extends CustomBinaryHandler and defines a sequence of BinaryFields via the #Field~ static pseudo-constructor methods. Everything else like setting the name, calculating the binary offsets, etc. is then done implicitly via reflection. Example on GitHub This example implements a custom type handler for the java.awt.image.BufferedImage class. Instead of storing the rather complex object structure of that class the image is serialized as PNG image format using javax.imageio.ImageIO into a byte array. This byte array is then stored by MicroStream. The custom type handler must be registered in the CustomTypeHandlerRegistry to enable it: EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage .Foundation(WORKINGDIR) .onConnectionFoundation(f -> f.registerCustomTypeHandlers(new CustomBufferedImageHandler()) ) .start(ROOT); Implementing a class can be skipped altogether by using the method Binary#TypeHandler and passing the BinaryFields directly. Registering such a generically created TypeHandler is not required, either, since Version 3 of MicroStream brought a solution to just define a static method in the entity class that will be recognized and used by MicroStream. The following is a simple technical example on how a custom binary handler can be easily defined and technically leveraged to optimize storage behavior.

This renders the application and the database incompatible. It’s like in an IDE. You change the structure of a class and the tooling takes care of the rest. Problem is, in a database, the \"rest\" can be, in some circumstances, several gigabytes or even more, that have to be refactored and written again. It’s one way to do it, but there are better alternatives. At best, the data is transformed when it’s accessed only. The old (legacy) type data is being mapped to the new type when it’s being loaded, hence: Legacy Type Mapping. Nothing needs to be rewritten. All records are, as they were saved, compatible with all other versions of their type. Simply by mapping while loading. What has to be done to achieve this? In the most common cases, nothing! The heuristic attempts to automatically detect which fields are new, have been removed, reordered or altered. Contact.java (old) public class Contact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; } Contact.java (new) public class Contact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNode ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } Console Output ---------- Legacy type mapping required for legacy type 1000055:Contact to current type 1000056:Contact Fields: java.lang.String Contact#firstname -1.000 ----> java.lang.String Contact#firstname java.lang.String Contact#name -0.750 ----> java.lang.String Contact#lastname java.lang.String Contact#email -0.708 ----> java.lang.String Contact#emailAddress java.lang.String Contact#note -0.636 ----> java.lang.String Contact#supportNode [***new***] PostalAddress Contact#postalAddress int Contact#age -1.000 ----> int Contact#age java.lang.Object Contact#link [discarded] --- Write 'y' to accept the mapping. The fields in the Contact entity class have been renamed, reordered, one was removed, one is new. What the heuristic is doing now is something like this: String firstname is equal in both classes, so it has to be the same, pretty much as int age. name and lastname is pretty similar, type is the same too. If there is nothing better for the two, they probably belong together. Same with the other two fields. In the end, the ominous link and postalAddress remain. The heuristic can not make sense of that, so it assumes that one thing falls away and the other one is added. In this particular example, that worked perfectly. Well done, heuristic. But: Just as people can make mistakes in estimating similarities (\"I would have thought …​\"), even programs can make mistakes as soon as they logically go on thin ice. There is nothing more with absolute correctness that you actually know from (bug-free) software. Such a similarity matching will be correct in the most cases, but sometimes it will also fall by the wayside. Example: perhaps only PostalAddress instances were referenced in the application under link and the two fields would actually be the same, only now properly typed and named. How should heuristics know that? Nobody could know that either, if he is not privy to the details of the concrete application. That’s why Legacy Type Mapping has two mechanisms that prevent things from going wrong: A callback interface is used to create the desired mapping result: PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor Optionally, an explicit mapping can be specified, which is then preferred to the heuristic approach. If you do not want that, you can simply set another resultor. Like in this example each suspected mapping is submitted once to the user for control in the console. This is done with the InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor. Maybe even one, where the user can \"rewire\" the mapping itself, write out the mapping, and then return an appropriate result. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(myDataDir); foundation.getConnectionFoundation().setLegacyTypeMappingResultor( InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() ) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(myRoot).start(); All you need is two columns of strings: from old to new. By default MicroStream uses a CSV file, but you can also write something else. In the end, a lot of string pairs for \"old → new\" mappings have to come into the program somewhere. The concept is simple: If there are two strings, this is interpreted as a mapping from an old thing to a new thing. If the second value is missing, it is interpreted as an old thing to be deleted. Missing the first value, then it’s as a new thing. Why call it \"thing\"? Because this applies to several structural elements: Constant identifier Class names Field names Example: count; articleCount means: the field named earlier count is called articleCount in the current version of the class. count; means: the early field count should be ignored during the mapping. More specifically, the values ​​of this field per record. ;articleCount means, this is a newly added field, DO NOT try to match it with anything else heuristically. You can also mix explicit mapping and heuristics. Only explicitly specify so many changes until the analysis gets the rest right by itself. That means you never have to specify the annoying trivial cases explicitly. Only the tricky ones. Usually, nothing should be necessary at all, or maybe a view indications at most to avoid mishaps. However, those who strictly prefer to make any change explicitly, instead of trusting a \"guessing\" software, can also do that. No problem. For class names, the three variants map, add and remove are somewhat tricky in meaning: Map is just old → new, same as with fields. To make an entry for a new class doesn’t make sense. It’s covered by the new class itself. You can do it, but it has no effect. Marking a removed class as deleted makes no sense either, except one special case. It is not required to specify the fields mapping of mapped classes if the mapping heuristic can do a correct field mapping. Especially if classes have been renamed only. Classes are simply referred to by their full qualified class name: com.my.app.entities.Order In some cases you need to specify the exact Version of the class, then the TypeId has to be prepended: 1012345:com.my.app.entities.Order Mapping from old to new: com.my.app.entities.Order;com.my.app.entities.OrderImplementation For fields it’s a bit more complex. To unambiguously refer a field, the full qualified name of its defining class has to be used. com.my.app.entities.Order#count;com.my.app.entities.Order#articleCount The # is based on official Java syntax, like e.g. in JavaDoc. If inheritance is involved, which must be uniquely resolved (each class in the hierarchy can have a field named \"count\"), you must also specify the declaring class. Like this: com.my.app.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#count; ⤦ com.my.App.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#articleCount A simple example: OldContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class OldContact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; // to be discarded } NewContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class NewContact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNote ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } refactorings.csv old current com.my.app.entities.OldContact com.my.app.entities.NewContact com.my.app.entities.OldContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.NewContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#name com.my.app.entities.NewContact#lastname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#email com.my.app.entities.NewContact#emailAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#note com.my.app.entities.NewContact#supportNote com.my.app.entities.NewContact#postalAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#age com.my.app.entities.NewContact#age com.my.app.entities.OldContact#link EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(dataDir); foundation.setRefactoringMappingProvider( Persistence.RefactoringMapping(Paths.get(\"refactorings.csv\")) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(root).start(); So far so good, all classes and fields are getting mapped, automatically or manually. But what about the data? How are the values getting transformed from old to new? Technically speaking it’s done fully automatic. But there are some interesting questions: What if the primitive types changes? What if primitives change to references and vice versa? How fast is it? Let’s say int to float. Just to copy the four bytes would yield wrong results. It has to be converted, like float floatValue = (float)intValue; Can it be done? Yes, fully automatic. The class BinaryValueTranslators does the job for you, it has a converter function from each primitive to another. Currently MicroStream supports conversion between primitives and their wrapper types, and vice versa. When converting a wrapper to a primitive, null is converted to 0. If you need special conversions between object types, you can add custom BinaryValueSetter for that, see customizing. How fast is that? The type analysis happens only once during initialization. If no exception occurs, the Legacy Type Mapping is ready-configured for each necessary type and will then only be called if required. For normal entity classes that are parsed by reflection, legacy type mapping loading is just as fast as a normal load. An array of such value translator functions is put together once and they are run through each time they are loaded. With legacy mapping, only the order and the target offsets are different, but the principle is the same as with normal loading. For custom handlers an intermediate step is necessary: ​​First put all the old values ​​together in an order that the custom handler expects and then read the binary data normally, as if loading a record in the current format. That’s necessary because MicroStream can’t know what such a custom handler does internally. If someone ever uses such a custom handler, the small detour is not likely to be noticeable in terms of performance. And if it should be the case and it has a negative effect on the productive operation: No problem, because: Of course you can also write a custom legacy type handler. It would run at full speed even with tricky special cases. Of course there is the possibility, as always, of intervening in the machinery massively with customizing. If you need the highest possible performance for some cases, or for logging / debugging, or anyway: Register any value translator implementations. In the simplest case this is 1 line of code, so do not worry. Being able to specify refactoring mapping in a different way than a CSV file is another example. You can even customize (extend or replace) the strategy that is looked up in refactoring mapping. Furthermore, you can also replace the heuristic logic with your own. This is easier than it sounds. This is just a primitive little interface (PersistenceMemberSimilator) and the default implementation thereof calls e.g. just a Levenshtein algorithm for names. You can certainly do that 10 times more clever. Or \"more appropriate\" for a particular application or programming style. E.g. utilize annotations. The basic statement is: If there is a problem somewhere, whether with the heuristic or a special case request or performance problem loading a gazillion entities all at once, or if there is a need for debugging in depth or something like that: do not panic. Most likely, this is easily possible with a few lines of code. Customizing examples You can not just mark classes as deleted. As long as there are records of a certain type in the database, the corresponding class must also exist so that the instances from the database can be loaded into the application. If there are no more records, then that means that there are only a few bytes of orphaned description in the type dictionary, but nobody cares. Is it possible to delete it by hand (or rather not, there are good reasons against it) or you can just ignore it and leave it there forever. In both cases, you must not mark a class as deleted. Now the special case: In the entity graph (root instances and all recursively reachable instances from there) all references to instances of a certain type are filled in. It’s done by the application logic or possibly by a specially written script. That is, all instances of this type are unreachable. No instance is available, no instance can ever be reloaded. This means that the type is \"deleted\" from the database at the logical level. One does not have to register anywhere, that is implicitly just like that. You can actually delete the corresponding Java class from the application project because it will never be needed again during the loading process at runtime. So far so good. There is only one problem: even if the instances are never logically accessible again: the data records are still around in the database files. The initialization scans over all database files, registers all entities, collects all occurring TypeIds and ensures for every TypeId that there is a TypeHandler for it. If necessary, a LegacyTypeHandler with mapping, but still: there must be a TypeHandler for each TypeId. And a TypeHandler needs a runtime type. That is, ass-backwards, over records that are logically already deleted, but only physically still lying around, now it is again enforced that the erasable entity class must be present. Bummer. One can prevent this: there is a \"cleanup\" function in the database management logic, which cleans up all logical gaps in the database files (actually copies all non-gaps into a new file and thus deletes the old file altogether). You would have to call it, then all physical occurrences of the unreachable records disappear and you could easily delete the associated class. But that is annoying. That is why it makes sense for these cases - and only for them - to do the following: If you as a developer are absolutely sure that no single instance of a given class is ever reachable again, i.e. must be loaded, then you can mark a type as \"deleted\" (rather \"unreachable\") in the refactoring mapping. Then the Type Handling will create a dummy TypeHandler that does not need a runtime class. See PersistenceUnreachableTypeHandler. But be careful: if you are mistaken and an instance of such a type is still referenced somewhere and eventually loaded later at runtime, then the Unreachable handler will throw an exception. At some point during the runtime of the application, not even during initialization. The cleanup provides real security: remove all logical gaps and if then with a deleted class no more error in the initialization occurs, it is really superfluous. Any ideas, such as simply returning null in the dummy type handler instead of an instance, are a fire hazard: it may dissolve some annoying situations pleasantly, but it would also mean that existing datasets, potentially entire subgraphs, become hidden from the application. Nevertheless, the database would continue to drag them along, perhaps becoming inexplicably large, and any search for the reason would yield nothing, because the dummy type handler keeps the data records secret. Shortsighted great, but catastrophic in the long run. That’s not good. The only clean solution is: you have to know what to do with your data model. As long as there are still available instances, they must also be loadable. The annoying special case above can be defused without side effects. But it can not be more than that, otherwise it will get rid of the chaos, problems and lost confidence in the correctness of the database solution.","title":"Legacy Type Mapping","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/7.0/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatic Mapping","hash":"_automatic_mapping","id":1},{"text":"Explicit Mapping","hash":"_explicit_mapping","id":2},{"text":"Explicit Mapping of Classes","hash":"_explicit_mapping_of_classes","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Mapping Syntax","hash":"_explicit_mapping_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Value Conversion","hash":"_value_conversion","id":5},{"text":"Value Conversion of Primitives","hash":"value-conversion-of-primitives","id":6},{"text":"Value Conversion of References / Objects","hash":"value-conversion-of-references","id":7},{"text":"Performance","hash":"performance","id":8},{"text":"Customizing","hash":"customizing","id":9},{"text":"Special Case: Deleted Class","hash":"special-case-deleted-class","id":10}]},"198":{"id":198,"text":"Here is an overview of how to enable and configure different levels of user interaction for the Legacy Type Mapping. Somewhere you have a foundation instance, a foundation in where everything is configured, from which the StorageManager is created. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(); // or from somewhere else It itself contains a foundation for connections. To access the inner thing needs a little detour. Incidentally, that’s not a JDBC connection, but this is just one thing that creates helper instances like Storer and Loader. Because Legacy Type Mapping affects loading, it has to go in there. Either you access it directly, like this: EmbeddedStorageConnectionFoundation f = foundation.getConnectionFoundation(); Or like this, that’s better for method chaining. foundation.onConnectionFoundation(f -> { ... }); If you have that, the configuration for the Legacy Type Mapping callback logic is just a one liner: f.setLegacyTypeMappingResultor(...); Default PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() That’s just the necessary logic, without anything further. If you do not change anything, this is done by default. With Console Output PrintingLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) That wraps a printer around the necessary logic. All these storage and persistence classes are nothing sacred or super-duper intertwined or anything. These are just interfaces and if you plug in another implementation then it will be used. Inquiry InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) Resultor which asks the user to apply. More customization is possible, see below. And so on With the implementation of just one single interface method, you can build anything else you can imagine. For example, logging to a file instead of the console. Or in the personally preferred logging framework. Or write confirmed mappings into the refactorings file. Everything is possible. For the inquiring implementation (InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor) there are a few settings: When should he ask? Always or only if something is unclear. Never does not make any sense of course, then you shouldn’t use it, or alternatively the printing resultor. When is a mapping unclear? If at least one field mapping is not completely clear. A field mapping is clear if: If two fields are exactly the same (similarity 1.0 or 100%) Or if two fields are specified by the explicit mapping. So if all fields are clear according to the above rule, then there is no need to ask. And there is another special case: If a field is discarded that is not explicitly marked as discardable, then as a precaution an inquiry is always done. Although no data is lost, but the data would not be available in the application, so better ask. There are options to control this a bit finer. You can optionally specify a double as a threshold (from 0.0 to 1.0, otherwise Exception): The value determines how similar two matching fields automatically have to be so that they are not inquired. Example: The value is 0.9 (90%), but a match found is only 0.8 (80%) similar. This is according to the specification too little, there must be an inquiry as a precaution. If you specify 1.0, that means: always ask, everything is really perfectly clear. If you enter 0.0, this means: never ask or only for implicitly dropping fields. Looks like this: InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) // implicitely 1.0 InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(), 0.7) // 0.7 threshold Here a small example with a Person class. int customerid ; // -> pin String firstname ; // -> firstName String surname ; // -> lastName String comment ; // discarded, NOT new commerceId It should be changed to: Integer pin ; // firstName surname -0,688----> lastName comment -0,750----> commerceId [***new***] address customerid [discarded] customerid and pin are too different to be automatically assigned to each other. Therefore, it is wrongly assumed that customerid is omitted and pin is new. comment and commerceId are surprisingly similar (75%) and are therefore assigned. But that’s not what we want. Incidentally, it would not matter here what is defined as a threshold: customerid would be eliminated by the implicit decision. This is too delicate not to inquire, so it is always necessary to ask. To get the mapping right, you have to specify two entries: customerid is now called pin and comment should be omitted Then the inquiry looks like this: customerid -[mapped]-> pin firstname -0,944----> firstName surname -0,688----> lastName [***new***] commerceId [***new***] address comment [discarded] Due to the explicit mapping from customerid to pin, the similarity does not matter, it is the mapping that matters. To indicate this, it says \"[mapped]\" instead of the similarity. The rest is as usual. Only comment is now \"[discarded]\", according to the mapping. The difference to the above is namely: This is an explicitly predetermined absence. That does not force inquiry. This clears the way for the threshold: If you enter 0.7 or more then you will be asked. As far as everything would be clear, but the mapping of surname to lastName is below the required \"minimum similarity\", so rather ask. If you enter 0.6 or less, you will no longer be asked. Because all assignments are either explicitly specified or they are according to \"minimum similarity\" similar enough to rely on it. A recommendation for a good value for the \"minimum similarity\" is difficult. As soon as one softens rules, there is always the danger of a mistake. See comment example above: is 75% similar to commerceId. Still wrong. Then prefer 80%? Or 90%? Of course it is better, but the danger is still there. If you want to be sure, just make 1.0 or omit the parameter, then by default 1.0 is taken. The most important is the explicit mapping anyway : if \"enough\" is given by the user, there is no need to ask.","title":"User Interaction","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"user-interaction","url":"/manual/7.0/storage/legacy-type-mapping/user-interaction.html","titles":[]},"199":{"id":199,"text":"Loading data can be done in two ways, eager and Lazy.

This style of work application always works with a copy of the data. Which allows it to use mutable data only within a single thread. The developer doesn’t have to worry about data synchronization and then store this data in a database transaction. This way of working is very practical, it does not require developers to have knowledge of multi-threaded programming and thanks to this it is very widespread. Can similar technical work be used when working with MicroStream? Of course, elegantly, very simply and safely we can use the ObjectCopier utility to create a deep copy of our data, change it, and save it back. Very simple idea, just create a purchase of actual data to work within the application and at the end save that data back. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. If the standard copy function is called over an object in Java, it creates a copy of that object, but the other object’s references remain the same. This doesn’t help so much. Because usually, an application contains a more complex data structure than a single object. This approach is called shallow copy. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying What is actually needed at this point is a deep copy. You need to create a complete copy of the complete subgraph from this object. MicroStream provides full support for a deep copy. It can be relatively easily called and a deep copy of the data will be created. ObjectCopier objectCopier = ObjectCopier.New(); Customer customer = root.getCustomer(id); Customer customerCopy = objectCopier.copy(customer); customerCopy.addPurchase(purchase); XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.setCustomer(id, customerCopy); storage.store(root.getcusomers()); } What are the parts of this code? Just create an instance of ObjectCopier class with factory method New(); Get the customer Make a deep copy of the customer object Modify this object graph In synchronized mode save this customer instead of the original customer and store it into a datastore This simple example written in pseudocode aims to demonstrate one of the many ways to solve working over a shared object graph in a multi-threaded environment.

You only need to call the store method on the correct object. The rule is: \"The Object that has been modified has to be stored!\". Storing objects that are not part of an object graph is most likely pointless. See Getting Started how to create a database with a root instance.

Businesses can change providers without rewriting their applications or maintaining a proprietary cache abstraction layer. This caching standard is used in a wide variety of environments. The most common use cases are: Second-level cache in JPA (e.g. Hibernate) Spring Cache Abstraction and many more Why another JCache implementation, you may wonder.

The Host and the Client application. The Host will open a network port and listen for incoming connections of the client.

To get a preconfigured foundation instance the classes ComBinaryDynamic and ComBinary provide the convenient method Foundation(). The Object communication of Microstream is available in two flavors: Dynamic and non dynamic. They differ in the way classes that should be serialized and transfered are handled: The non dynamic version requires all classes that should be transfered to be registered at initialization time. This can be done with the registerEntityType methods of the ComFoundation. If a transfered object graph references any unregistered class an exception will occur! The dynamic implementation automatically registers all classes that are part of the communication at runtime. It will also do a type-mapping if classes with the same name have different implementations on client and host. host binding address The host’s IP address is configured with ComFoundation.setHostBindingAddress(InetSocketAddress). client target address The address the client connects to is configured by ComFoundation.setClientTargetAddress(InetSocketAddress). port only If no host or client target address is configured it is possible to use ComFoundation.setPort(int) to set a port that is used together with the default ip addresses for host and client. registering entity types to register entity types at startup use ComFoundation.registerEntityTypes(Class…​) for example.

General purpose configuration layer on which the storage and cache configuration are now based on, with following key features: Tree like structure to support sub-configurations Input from various sources (ini, xml, yaml, …​) Typed getters for properties Extendable: custom property parsers and configuration loaders Adaptable: easy adaption to other framework’s configurations, like e.g. Spring Boot Storage configuration now supports different file systems for live storage and backup GraalVM support: MicroStream’s optimized memory adapter is now used automatically when running on GraalVM Restructured MicroStream’s module and package structure to fully support the Java Module System and adopt Maven naming standards, see Migration Guide Fixed sporadic index out of bounds exception when storage and backup had different storage targets with a channel count greater than one In order to fully support the Java Module System and adopt Maven naming standards we had to introduce some changes: These are the changed artifacts and their packages.

File System Abstraction to support a variety of storage targets. Exporter API for storage configuration. Better error handling in housekeeping, to avoid storage channel thread interruptions. Fixed XML loading bug under Android. All configuration code, which includes file paths, may be rewritten to use the new Abstract File System. For example see Storage Files or Backup. Bugfix release for projects using an old non public version. Fixed bug in type dictionary parser for old legacy type handlers Added a convenience layer for defining custom type handlers Fully automatic lazy reference managing for clearing older Lazy references as free memory gets lower. Completed optimized persistence handling for remaining types in JDK that are reasonable to appear in entity graphs. E.g. Currency, Locale, URI, URL, Path Compatibility with projects using java modules (\"jigsaw\") Added JavaDoc for common types like StorageConnection, StorageManager, StorageController, etc. Auto-recognition for CSV separator character in configuration files (e.g. legacy type mapping) JSR-107 compatible JCache provider with additional Hibernate cache region factory Storage REST Service and Client are available to access the storage data via REST, a Java-Wrapper thereof and a Web-UI Fixed a potential race condition during loading Fixed a potential race condition and robustness issue during storing StorageConnectionFoundation instance is now properly created on demand. Removed unnecessary memory consumption exponential to channel count. Improved exception messages on invalid configuration values (file sizes etc.) Workarounded a JDK bug regarding file locking when importing files (JDK exception says another process is locking the file which is outright wrong) Fixed type resolving problems when different ClassLoaders are involved. Fixed a bug that caused loading of zero-length arrays to throw an exception despite everything being fine. Various smaller bugfixes for unnecessary exceptions in special cases and state robustness after exceptions. From 2.2 no actions are necessary, for older versions see below. Removed SelfStoring without replacement since it could not be used recursively and has no advantages over just creating a static storing utility method for a certain entity. Added state validation of value type objects (e.g. String, Integer, BigDecimal, etc.) upon loading. This is hardly relevant in practice, but not having it can lead to confusing hello-world-like test applications. EmbeddedStorageManager now implements java.lang.AutoClosable. Replaced all provisional RuntimeExceptions with either PersistenceException or StorageException, depending on the architectural level the corresponding source code it located. The two technically different root handling concepts (\"default\" and \"custom\") have been consolidated in a way that they are the same thing on the API level and interchangeable, meaning no more confusion with those root exception messages. All entity fields of type transient EmbeddedStorageManager now get a reference to the used EmbeddedStorageManager instance set upon loading/updating. The interfaces around storage managing have been enhanced so that it is now equally valid to just write StorageManager instead of EmbeddedStorageManager. (An EmbeddedStorageManager \"is a\" StorageManager) Slight technical consolidation of Lazy reference handling caused the type Lazy to be moved from the package one.microstream.persistence.lazy to one.microstream.reference. The reason is that the lazy handling has actually no inherent connection to persistence or storage. It’s actually just a generic concept that can be used by those layers. See Migration Guide below on how to adjust existing projects. Fixed an off-heap memory leak when restarting the storage multiple times in the same process. Fixed a bug where changing the fields of an entity type caused an exception. This was a regression bug from fixing a similar problem for another case in version 2.1. Now, both cases work correctly. All occurrences in user code of one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy have to be refactored to one.microstream.reference.Lazy. Modern IDEs provide a functionality to \"auto-import\" missing types or automatically \"organize imports\", so this should be resolved with a proverbial push of a button. Android support MicroStream is now Java-wise fully compatible with Android. Replaced all usages of java.util.File with java.nio.file.Path to allow using custom file implementations. Improved skipping functionality of Storers (see EmbeddedStorageManager#createStorer and Storer#skip). The class Lazy is now an interface to allow custom implementations. See Migration guide below. Fixed a few minor bugs in the skipping functionality of Storers. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after the storage was shut down. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after an exception in storage initialization. Enums defining an abstract method are now handled correctly. By default, all threads created by MicroStream now start with the prefix \"MicroStream-\". This can be customized by the new interface StorageThreadNameProvider. Fixed a NullPointerException in import. Fixed a bug that caused enums with a certain field layout to be loaded inconsistently. java.util.Locale is now persisted and created using Locale’s #toLanguageTag and #forLanguageTag. In the directory of an existing storage, in the TypeDictionary file (default name \"PersistenceTypeDictionary.ptd\"), all occurrences of \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy\" must be replaced with \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy$Default\".","title":"Changelog","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"changelog","url":"/manual/7.0/intro/changelog.html","titles":[{"text":"7.1","hash":"_7_1","id":1},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features","id":2},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes","id":3},{"text":"7.0","hash":"_7_0","id":4},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_2","id":5},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_2","id":6},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide","id":7},{"text":"6.1","hash":"_6_1","id":8},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_3","id":9},{"text":"6.0","hash":"_6_0","id":10},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_3","id":11},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_4","id":12},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide_2","id":13},{"text":"5.0.2","hash":"_5_0_2","id":14},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_5","id":15},{"text":"5.0.1","hash":"_5_0_1","id":16},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_6","id":17},{"text":"5.0","hash":"_5_0","id":18},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_4","id":19},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_7","id":20},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"5_0_migration-guide","id":21},{"text":"Artifacts and Packages","hash":"_artifacts_and_packages","id":22},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":23},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":24},{"text":"Storage","hash":"_storage","id":25},{"text":"4.1","hash":"_4_1","id":26},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_5","id":27},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_8","id":28},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"4_1_migration-guide","id":29},{"text":"4.0","hash":"_4_0","id":30},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_6","id":31},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_9","id":32},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"4_0_migration-guide","id":33},{"text":"3.0.1","hash":"_3_0_1","id":34},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_10","id":35},{"text":"3.0","hash":"_3_0","id":36},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_7","id":37},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_11","id":38},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"3_0_migration-guide","id":39},{"text":"2.2","hash":"_2_2","id":40},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_8","id":41},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_12","id":42},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"2_2_migration-guide","id":43},{"text":"2.1","hash":"_2_1","id":44},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_9","id":45},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_13","id":46},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"_migration_guide_3","id":47}]},"217":{"id":217,"text":"You can find the MicroStream libraries in the Maven Central repository.

Only data is transferred, no program code (\"bytecode\"). The other application may be programmed in any language as long as it adheres to the transmitted communication protocol. Usable directly in the program code of a Java application to communicate with other applications or processes. The concrete form of persistence is left open and delivered via a specific implementation as a plugin. Examples of specific persistent forms are binary data, CSV, XML, Json. microstream-communication-binary Plugin framework for the top-level framework communication to convert the transferred object graphs to and from binary data. microstream-configuration General-purpose configuration layer. microstream-configuration-hocon Hocon extension for the configuration layer, which supports hocon, json and ini files. microstream-configuration-yaml Yaml extension for the configuration layer. microstream-afs Abstract file system (AFS) layer. microstream-afs-aws-dynamodb File system implementations for AWS DynamoDB. microstream-afs-aws-s3 File system implementations for AWS S3. microstream-afs-azure-storage File system implementations for Azure Cloud (Azure Storage). microstream-afs-blobstore Base for all blob store file system implementations. microstream-afs-hazelcast File system implementation for Hazelcast. microstream-afs-hibernate Generic file system implementation for JPA / Hibernate. microstream-afs-kafka File system implementation for Apache Kafka. microstream-afs-mongodb File system implementation for MongoDB. microstream-afs-nio File system implementation for the non-blocking IO implementation (java.nio.file) of the JDK. microstream-afs-oraclecloud-objectstorage File system implementation for Oracle Cloud Services (Object Storage). microstream-afs-oracle-coherence File system implementation for Oracle Coherence. microstream-afs-oracle-nosql File system implementation for Oracle NoSQL. microstream-afs-redis File system implementation for Redis. microstream-afs-sql File system implementation for SQL databases. microstream-persistence Base framework to convert a graph of java objects into a persistent form and back. Usable as a common, abstract base for all technologies implementing a specific persistent representation like binary data, CSV, XML or Json. From a technical point of view, storage as well as serialization is a process that puts a graph of Java instances into a persistent form. The only difference is that network communication serialization discards this persistent form while a database solution preserves it. microstream-persistence-binary Extension of the persistence base framework with a concrete implementation of the persistent form as binary data. This persistent form is superior to all text-based formats in storage and performance needs, making it the preferred method for storage and network serialization. microstream-persistence-binary-jdk8 Specialized type handlers for JDK 8 collection types. microstream-persistence-binary-jdk17 Specialized type handlers for immutable JDK 17 collection types. microstream-storage Basic framework to manage a graph of Java data persisted as binary data as a database. Can be used both to implement an embedded database solution (in the same process as the Java application) and a standalone or server-mode database solution (in a separate process). Other forms of persistence than binary data are deliberately not supported because they would not bring any noteworthy advantages but many disadvantages for the task. microstream-storage-embedded Top-level framework for use in a Java application that adds an embedded database solution to its object graphs. Can be used directly in the program code of a Java application to comfortably and efficiently persist its data. microstream-storage-embedded-configuration Layer with support for external configuration files (XML, INI) and convenience functionality to create foundations for the embedded storage. microstream-storage-restadapter Adapter for low-level storage data externalization.

When called, the reference held in the Lazy Reference is removed and only the ID is kept so that the instance can be reloaded when needed. Important background knowledge: However, such a clear does not mean that the referenced instance immediately disappears from memory. That’s the job of the garbage collector of the JVM. The reference is even registered in another place, namely in a global directory (Swizzle Registry), in which each known instance is registered with its ObjectId in a bijective manner. This means: if you clear such a reference, but shortly thereafter the Lazy Reference is queried again, probably nothing has to be loaded from the database, but simply the reference from the Swizzle Registry is restored. Nevertheless, the Swizzle Registry is not a memory leak, because it references the instances only via WeakReference. In short, if an instance is only referenced as \"weak,\" the JVM GC will still clean it up. So that the Lazy References do not have to be managed manually, but the whole goes automatically, there is the following mechanism: Each Lazy instance has a lastTouched timestamp. Each .get() call sets it to the current time. This will tell you how long a Lazy Reference has not been used, i.e. if it is needed at all. The LazyReferenceManager audits this. It is enabled by default, with a timeout of 1,000,000 milliseconds, which is about 15 minutes. A custom manager can be set easily, which should happen before a storage is started. LazyReferenceManager.set(LazyReferenceManager.New( Lazy.Checker( Duration.ofMinutes(30).toMillis(), // timeout of lazy access 0.75 // memory quota ) ); The timeout of lazy references is set to 30 minutes, meaning references which haven’t been touched for this time are cleared.

Of course, it’s not really about the technical implementation of procrastination, but about efficiency: why bloat the limited RAM with stuff before you even need it? Classic example: The application has self-contained data areas that contain a large amount of data. The data for an area is not loaded if the area is not worked at all. Instead, you only load a tiny amount of \"head data\" for each area (name or other for displaying purposes) and the actual data only when the application really needs it. E.g. fiscal years with hundreds of thousands or millions of sales. One million revenue records for 2010, one million for 2011, for 2012, etc. In 2019, most of the time only 2019 and 2018 will be needed. The previous few, and the year 2000 sales are not of great interest anymore. Therefore: load data only when needed. Super efficient. For example let’s say the app \"MyBusinessApp\" has a root instance class, looking like this: public class MyBusinessApp { // ... private HashMap businessYears = new HashMap<>(); // ... } The business year hold the turnovers: public class BusinessYear { // ... private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); // ... } This approach would be a problem: During initialization, the root instance would be loaded, from there its HashMap with all BusinessYear instances, each with its ArrayList and thus all conversions. For all years. 20 years of approximately 1 million sales makes 20 million entities, which are pumped directly into the RAM at the start. It does not matter if someone needs it or not. We don’t want it that way. It would be nice if you could simply add a \"lazy\" to the turnover list. And that’s exactly how it works: public class BusinessYear { // ... private Lazy> turnovers = ...; // we will get to that // ... } And bingo, the turnovers are now loaded lazily. Of course, this is no longer an ArrayList field, which is now magically loaded lazy, but this is now a Lazy field and the instances of this type are typed generically to ArrayList . Lazy is just a simple class whose instances internally hold an ID and a reference to the actual thing (here the ArrayList instance). If the internal reference is zero, the reserved ID is used to reload it. If it is not null, it is simply returned. So just a reference intermediate instance. Similar to the JDK’s WeakReference, just not JVM-weak, but storage-lazy. What do you have to do now to get the actual ArrayList instance? ArrayList turnovers = this.turnovers.get(); Just as with WeakReference, or simply as one would expect from a reference intermediate type in general: a simple get method. The .get() call reloads the data as needed. But you do not want to mess around with that yourself. No \"SELECT bla FROM turnovers WHERE ID =\" + this.turnovers.getId(). Since you want to program your application you don' t have to mess around with low-level database ID-loading stuff. That’s what the MicroStream Code does internally. You do not even need to access the ID, you just have to say \"get!\". That’s it. There are different strategies, what you write here. Analogous to the code example before it would be simply: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(new ArrayList<>()); So always a new ArrayList instance, wrapped in a Lazy instance. If the actual ArrayList reference should be null at first, it works the same way: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(null); The this.turnovers.get() also just always returns null. Completely transparent. But you could also do this: private Lazy> turnovers = null; If there is no list, then you do not make any intermediate reference instance for any list. A separate instance for null is indeed a bit …​ meh. But that has a nasty problem elsewhere: this.turnovers.get() does not work then. Because NullPointerException. Anytime you need to write this here, the readability of code is not exactly conducive: return this.turnovers == null ? null : this.turnovers.get(); But there is a simple solution: Just move this check into a static utility method. Just like that: return Lazy.get(this.turnovers); This is the same .get(), just with a static null-check around it. This always puts you on the safe side. For Lazy Loading, simply wrap Lazy<> around the actual field and then call .get() or maybe better Lazy.get(...). It’s as simple as that. The full example can be found on GitHub. Why do you have to replace your actual instance with a lazy loading intermediate instance and fiddle around with generics? Why is not something like this: @Lazy private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); Put simply: If it were just that it would be bare Java bytecode for accessing an ArrayList. There would be no way for a middleware library to get access and look it up and perhaps reload it. What’s written there is an ArrayList reference. There is no lazy anymore. Either, the instance is null, or it is not null. If you wanted to reach in there, you would have to start with bytecode manipulation. Technically possible, but something you really don’t want in your application. So there must always be some form of intermediary. Hibernate solves this through its own collection implementations that do lazy loading internally. Although the lazy loading is nicely hidden in some way (or not, if you need an annotation for that), it also comes with all sorts of limitations. You can only use interfaces instead of concrete classes for collections. At first, the instance is not the one you dictate, the code becomes non-transparent and difficult to debug, you have to use a collection, even if it’s just a single instance, and so on. You want to be able to write anything you want and you want full insight and control (debugability, etc.) over the code. All this can be done with the tiny Lazy Interim Reference class. No restrictions, no incomprehensible \"magic\" under the hood (proxy instances and stuff) and also usable for individual instances.","title":"Lazy Loading","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/7.0/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What about the \"…​\" ?","hash":"_what_about_the","id":1},{"text":"In Short","hash":"_in_short","id":2},{"text":"Side Note","hash":"_side_note","id":3}]},"225":{"id":225,"text":"For convenience MicroStream provides Null-safe static access methods for lazy references.

It is available within this artifact: pom.xml one.microstream microstream-integrations-cdi 07.01.00-MS-GA The integration requires the javax namespace and requires a CDI 2.0 implementation or higher and an Eclipse MicroProfile Config 2.0 implementation or higher. The configuration of the StorageManager can be done using key/value pairs that are provided by MicroProfile Config. The configuration keys must be prefixed by one.microstream one.microstream.storage-directory=/opt/data/microstream one.microstream.channel-count=2 Since the - character is not supported in some sources (like the environment variables), you can also define the configuration keys using the . character. one.microstream.storage.directory=/opt/data/microstream one.microstream.channel.count=2 Besides that, the regular MicroProfile Config rules about keys are applied (since we are using MicroProfile Config directly, see specification). The configured and started StorageManager is a CDI bean and thus can be injected or retrieved programmatically. @Inject private StorageManager storageManager; public void someMethod() { StorageManager storageManager = CDI.current().select(StorageManager.class).get(); } The StorageManager configuration can be customized by CDI beans that implement the interface one.microstream.integrations.cdi.types.config.EmbeddedStorageFoundationCustomizer. The customize method is called with an EmbeddedStorageFoundation which allows you to fully customize the StorageManager that will be created. You can for example, add the specific Type Handlers for JDK 8 as described on the documentation. After the StorageManager is created, the CDI beans that implement one.microstream.integrations.cdi.types.config.StorageManagerInitializer are called. You have the opportunity to perform actions on the StorageManager or root object. Following rules apply to the StorageManager that is passed to the initialize method of the interface. The StorageManager is already started unless you specified the configuration value one.microstream.autoStart=false. If you have used the @Storage annotation on a class, the StorageManager is already associated with an instance of that class as the Root object. There is a second option to configure and retrieve the StorageManager, and it makes use of the MicroStream functionality to read the configuration from any file. @Inject @ConfigProperty(name = \"one.microstream.ini\") private StorageManager storageManager; The above construct makes use of the MicroProfile Config functionality that you convert the value of the key one.microstream.ini and convert it into a StorageManager. The value of the key is expected to point to an existing file. The formats XML, INI, and properties are supported. The StorageManager is also fully configured and started just as you would use it when using the first option of configuration. If you define it multiple times, within different beans for example, you always receive the same instance of the StorageManager when you specify the same value for the name member of the @ConfigProperty annotation. This way, you can define and use multiple _StorageManager_s within your application. The customizer and initializer features described earlier as CDI beans implementing a specific interface,are also available when you use the MicroProfile Config annotation (@ConfigProperty). Since you can define multiple StorageManager_s this way, you can distinguish between them based on the _database name. The database name can be set by using the following property within the configuration file (example makes use of the properties format, but it is also supported in the other formats) database-name=theName If this property is not specified, the value of the MicroProfile config key (used within the name member of @ConfigProperty) is used. Within the customizer and initializer you can use this to perform the required actions based on the instance you receive. EmbeddedStorageFoundation.getDataBaseName(); StorageManager.databaseName(); The root object can be indicated by using the @Storage annotation on the class. This annotation converts the POJO into a CDI bean (there is no need to use any scope-defining annotation) with Application Scope. This is only supported when you inject the StorageManager without making use of the MicroProfile Config @ConfigProperty annotation. Besides converting it into a CDI bean, any field injection within this class is also resolved. The integration also defines the instance of the class that is created as the root object (StorageManager.setRoot()) and stores the initial value (StorageManager.storeRoot()) when storageManager does not have a root object assigned yet (this happens only the very first time when you start up your application and the storage doesn’t contain any data yet) The POJO must have a (default) no-argument constructor so that the integration can create an instance of it. You can only annotate 1 class with the @Storage annotation, if you have marked multiple, the deployment of your application will fail at the CDI validation phase.","title":"CDI Extension","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"cdi","url":"/manual/7.0/misc/integrations/cdi.html","titles":[{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":1},{"text":"Root object","hash":"_root_object","id":2}]},"244":{"id":244,"text":"The Helidon integration for MicroStream ships with the official Helidon releases, and is hosted at Oracle’s Github repository.

It is available within this artifact: pom.xml one.microstream microstream-integrations-spring-boot 07.01.00-MS-GA Official Spring Boot site: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot The integration requires Spring Boot 2.x (with version 2.1.0.RELEASE being the minimal supported one). Since version 8.0.0, the StorageManager that is instantiated by the integration is also started where the previous version of the integration did not start the manager. You can have the old behaviour of a StorageManager that is not started by specifying the config value one.microstream.auto-start=false. The configuration of the StorageManager can be done using key/value pairs that are provided by Spring Boot external Configuration. The configuration keys must be prefixed by one.microstream one.microstream.storage-directory=/opt/data/microstream one.microstream.channel-count=2 The list of all MicroStream configuration properties and their meaning are listed on our documentation page. The configuration values are handled using the typesafe configuration approach, and you can read these values by accessing the MicrostreamConfigurationProperties Spring bean. You can either create a StorageManager yourself from an EmbeddedStorageFoundation Spring bean or access a fully configured one through the StorageManager Spring bean. Be aware that since both share the same configuration values, if you create and start a StorageManager from EmbeddedStorageFoundation, it will conflict with the one from the StorageManager Spring bean. When you use the EmbeddedStorageFoundation Spring bean, don’t access the StorageManager bean. The EmbeddedStorageFoundation one is ideal if your Spring application is performing one-of tasks like for example Batch processing. The other one is suited in most cases and the StorageManager can be customized and initialized before it is actually used. Also, note that when using the feature of having the Root object as Spring Bean already creates and initializes the StorageManager. The StorageManager configuration can be customized by Spring beans that implement the interface one.microstream.integrations.spring.boot.types.config.EmbeddedStorageFoundationCustomizer. The customize method is called with an EmbeddedStorageFoundation which allows you to fully customize the StorageManager that will be created. You can for example, add the specific Type Handlers for JDK 8 as described on the documentation.

The StorageManager is already started unless you specified the configuration value one.microstream.auto-start=false. If you have used the @Storage annotation on a class, the StorageManager is already associated with an instance of that class as the Root object. The root object can be indicated by using the @Storage annotation on the class. This annotation converts the POJO into a Spring bean (The annotation is a Spring Qualifier that makes the class also a Component). Besides converting it into a Spring bean, any field or setter injection within this class is also resolved. Please note that constructor injection is not supported and will result in an error indicating that the class has not a no-argument constructor. The integration also defines the instance of the class that is created as the root object (StorageManager.setRoot()) and stores the initial value (StorageManager.storeRoot()) when storageManager does not have a root object assigned yet (this happens only the very first time when you start up your application and the storage doesn’t contain any data yet) You can only annotate 1 class with the @Storage annotation, if you have marked multiple, the creation of the Storage Spring bean will fail with a BeansException. When using the @Storage functionality, you as a developer should not change the root object of the StorageManager yourself anymore as that will lead to conflicts and mismatches between the Spring bean created for the Root object and your newly set instance on the StorageManager. By default, Spring creates all singleton beans at the start of the application. The Spring beans defined by the MicroStream integration, like StorageManager and Storage root bean, are singletons. So they are created at startup which means that for example when you are using a database as a storage target, the database must be available and accessible when the application starts up. When this is not desired, because the database might be only available when the user request arrives and not at application startup, you can use the Provider option. Add the Jakarta Inject dependency to your project jakarta.inject jakarta.inject-api 1.0 And use injection based on the Provider and not the actual class itself. private final Provider storageManagerProvider; public UserRepository(Provider storageManagerProvider) { this.storageManagerProvider = storageManagerProvider; } When you need to access the StorageManager Spring bean, you perform storageManagerProvider.get() statement, and only at that point the StorageManager is created as a Spring bean. This allows you to delay the creation until the first user request. MicroStream Spring module supports standard Spring logging, so you can add this into your config: logging.level.one.microstream=debug to obtain all MicroStream configuration keys: 2021-08-23 15:16:02.979 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : Microstream configuration items: 2021-08-23 15:16:02.979 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-filesystem.sql.postgres.password : xxxxx 2021-08-23 15:16:02.994 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-filesystem.sql.postgres.data-source-provider : one.microstream.test.spring.MyDataSourceProvider 2021-08-23 15:16:02.994 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-directory : microstream_storage 2021-08-23 15:16:02.994 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-filesystem.sql.postgres.user : postgres Key values containing \"password\" are replaced by \"xxxxx\".

This also allows the actual data instance to be immutable, while at the same time leaving referential integrity of an entity graph intact. MicroStream provides ready-to-use logic layers for: Logging Versioning While the layers admittedly introduce considerable technical complexity and runtime overhead, this concept is a production ready solution for nearly all requirements regarding cross cutting concerns and aspects. To use this concept in your code, there need to be at least implementations for the entity’s identity and data. Let’s say the entity looks like this: public interface Person extends Entity { public String firstName(); public String lastName(); } There needs to be a identity class: public class PersonEntity extends EntityLayerIdentity implements Person { protected PersonEntity() { super(); } @Override protected Person entityData() { return (Person)super.entityData(); } @Override public final String firstName() { return this.entityData().firstName(); } @Override public final String lastName() { return this.entityData().lastName(); } } And a data class: public class PersonData extends EntityData implements Person { private final String firstName; private final String lastName ; protected PersonData(final Person entity, final String firstName, final String lastName ) { super(entity); this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName ; } @Override public String firstName() { return this.firstName; } @Override public String lastName() { return this.lastName; } } A lot of code to write to get an entity with two properties! But don’t worry, there is a code generator for that. An annotation processor to be precise. The only code you have to provide are the entity interfaces, all the other stuff will be generated. Just add the annotation processor type one.microstream.entity.codegen.EntityProcessor to your compiler configuration. That’s it.

PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Smith\"); PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Archer\"); PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Bennett\"); john.lastName() // now returns \"Bennett\" If you want to access older versions use the context: versionContext.versions(john).get(1L); // -> \"John Smith\" To limit the amount of preserved versions, a cleaner can be utilized: EntityVersionCleaner versionCleaner = EntityVersionCleaner.AmountPreserving(10); EntityVersionContext versionContext = EntityVersionContext.AutoIncrementingLong(cleaner); This will keep only the last ten versions of the person. Additionally to number keys, timestamps can be used as well. EntityVersionContext systemTimeContext = EntityVersionContext.AutoIncrementingSystemTimeMillis(); EntityVersionContext nanoTimeContext = EntityVersionContext.AutoIncrementingSystemNanoTime(); EntityVersionContext instantContext = EntityVersionContext.AutoIncrementingInstant(); They can be preserved for a specific time range: EntityVersionCleaner cleaner = EntityVersionCleaner.AgePreservingInstant(Duration.of(1, ChronoUnit.YEARS)); EntityVersionContext context = EntityVersionContext.AutoIncrementingInstant(cleaner); The version context can be used as a shared state object. So you can control versioning for multiple entities at once, or even for the hole entity graph. The auto-incrementing contexts take care of the key creation. If you need to control it by yourself, use the mutable context. But be aware that you have to set the version before updating any data, otherwise the current one will be overwritten. EntityVersionContext.Mutable versionContext = EntityVersionContext.Mutable(); versionContext.currentVersion(\"rev-1\"); Person john = PersonCreator.New() .addLayer(versionContext) .firstName(\"John\") .lastName(\"Doe\") .create(); versionContext.currentVersion(\"rev-2\"); PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Smith\"); versionContext.currentVersion(\"rev-3\"); PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Archer\"); versionContext.currentVersion(\"rev-4\"); PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Bennett\");","title":"Versioning","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"versioning","url":"/manual/7.0/misc/layered-entities/versioning.html","titles":[]},"255":{"id":255,"text":"MicroStream logs against the simple logging facade SLF4J.

That’s what the microstream.wrapper.types parameter is for. This is just a comma separated list of types. Alternatively you can use the GenerateWrapperFor annotation: @GenerateWrapperFor(\"one.microstream.persistence.types.PersistenceStoring\") public class WrapperGenerationDummy { } It accepts a list of type names.

All types in the public API are, whenever possible, interfaces. This offers the best possibilities to extend or exchange parts of the engine. A good ways to enrich a type with features, is the wrapper (decorator) pattern. For example, let’s say we want to add logging to the PersistenceStoring's store(object) method. PersistenceStoring.java public interface PersistenceStoring { public long store(Object instance); public long[] storeAll(Object... instances); public void storeAll(Iterable instances); public void storeSelfStoring(SelfStoring storing); } Conventionally it would be done that way: A new type, implementing the original interface, would be handed over the wrapped instance, all interface methods have to be implemented and delegated. And in the single method, we wanted to add functionality; the actual implementation of the logging is done. public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } This produces a lot of overhead. In this case, three methods are just boilerplate code to delegate the calls to the wrapped instance. A common solution for that is to create an abstract base wrapper type for the designated interface, and to reuse it whenever needed. public abstract class BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } And then, based on that, the implementation of the logger type would look like this: public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging extends BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring { public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(wrapped); } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return super.store(instance); } } That’s better. No more boilerplate code. Just overwrite the methods you want to extend. The only work left is, to generate the base wrapper types. One way is to let your IDE generate the wrapper or delegation code. Disadvantage of that is, it has to be redone every time your interfaces change. A code generator, which does it automatically would be nice. And that’s what the base module brings along. Like the layered entity code generator, it is an annotation processor.","title":"Wrapping","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"index","url":"/manual/7.0/misc/wrapping/index.html","titles":[]},"258":{"id":258,"text":"MicroStream’s wrapper code generator generates following wrapper type for PersistenceStoring: public interface WrapperPersistenceStoring extends Wrapper, PersistenceStoring { @Override public default long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped().store(instance); } @Override public default long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped().storeAll(instances); } @Override public default void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped().storeAll(instances); } @Override public default void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped().storeSelfStoring(storing); } } It is not an abstract class, but an interface, which extends the Wrapper interface of the microstream-base module, and the wrapped type itself. This offers you the most flexible way to use it in your application. The Wrapper type is just a typed interface and an abstract implementation of itself. Wrapper.java public interface Wrapper { public W wrapped(); public abstract class Abstract implements Wrapper { private final W wrapped; protected Abstract(final W wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public final W wrapped() { return this.wrapped; } } } You can either implement the Wrapper interface and provide the wrapped instance via the wrapped() method, or you can extend the abstract class and hand over the wrapped instance to the super constructor. Version with the abstract type: public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging extends Wrapper.Abstract implements WrapperPersistenceStoring { public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(wrapped); } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return WrapperPersistenceStoring.super.store(instance); } } Or only the interface, then you have to provide the wrapped instance via wrapped(): public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging implements WrapperPersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public PersistenceStoring wrapped() { return this.wrapped; } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return WrapperPersistenceStoring.super.store(instance); } }","title":"Usage","component":"manual","version":"7.0","name":"usage","url":"/manual/7.0/misc/wrapping/usage.html","titles":[]},"259":{"id":259,"text":"Upgrade to Java 11 [359] Lazy Collections Quarkus integration [422] Update CDI integration to use Jakarta EE [509] [513] Support for Multiple StorageManagers within Spring Boot 2.x [490] Java 17 type handler improvement [462] Read-only mode [427] [436] Serializer with type information [376] Channel count migration tool [371] Helidon MP example update [444] More convenient API for import, export and CSV conversion [535] Built-in SBOM [460] Spring Boot 3.x fixes [504] Set appropriate ClassLoaderProvider in Spring Boot integrations [517] [518] Maven 4 build compliance [471] Helidon example build fix [463] Spring integration fixes [415] File deletion fix [408] Cache read through fix [369] Define service providers in module info [368] When you are still on an older Java version, remember to upgrade to Java 11 or above.

Fixed XML loading bug under Android. All configuration code, which includes file paths, may be rewritten to use the new Abstract File System. For example see Storage Files or Backup. Bugfix release for projects using an old non public version. Fixed bug in type dictionary parser for old legacy type handlers Added a convenience layer for defining custom type handlers Fully automatic lazy reference managing for clearing older Lazy references as free memory gets lower. Completed optimized persistence handling for remaining types in JDK that are reasonable to appear in entity graphs. E.g. Currency, Locale, URI, URL, Path Compatibility with projects using java modules (\"jigsaw\") Added JavaDoc for common types like StorageConnection, StorageManager, StorageController, etc. Auto-recognition for CSV separator character in configuration files (e.g. legacy type mapping) JSR-107 compatible JCache provider with additional Hibernate cache region factory Storage REST Service and Client are available to access the storage data via REST, a Java-Wrapper thereof and a Web-UI Fixed a potential race condition during loading Fixed a potential race condition and robustness issue during storing StorageConnectionFoundation instance is now properly created on demand. Removed unnecessary memory consumption exponential to channel count. Improved exception messages on invalid configuration values (file sizes etc.) Workarounded a JDK bug regarding file locking when importing files (JDK exception says another process is locking the file which is outright wrong) Fixed type resolving problems when different ClassLoaders are involved. Fixed a bug that caused loading of zero-length arrays to throw an exception despite everything being fine. Various smaller bugfixes for unnecessary exceptions in special cases and state robustness after exceptions. From 2.2 no actions are necessary, for older versions see below. Removed SelfStoring without replacement since it could not be used recursively and has no advantages over just creating a static storing utility method for a certain entity. Added state validation of value type objects (e.g. String, Integer, BigDecimal, etc.) upon loading. This is hardly relevant in practice, but not having it can lead to confusing hello-world-like test applications. EmbeddedStorageManager now implements java.lang.AutoClosable. Replaced all provisional RuntimeExceptions with either PersistenceException or StorageException, depending on the architectural level the corresponding source code it located. The two technically different root handling concepts (\"default\" and \"custom\") have been consolidated in a way that they are the same thing on the API level and interchangeable, meaning no more confusion with those root exception messages. All entity fields of type transient EmbeddedStorageManager now get a reference to the used EmbeddedStorageManager instance set upon loading/updating. The interfaces around storage managing have been enhanced so that it is now equally valid to just write StorageManager instead of EmbeddedStorageManager. (An EmbeddedStorageManager \"is a\" StorageManager) Slight technical consolidation of Lazy reference handling caused the type Lazy to be moved from the package one.microstream.persistence.lazy to one.microstream.reference. The reason is that the lazy handling has actually no inherent connection to persistence or storage. It’s actually just a generic concept that can be used by those layers. See Migration Guide below on how to adjust existing projects. Fixed an off-heap memory leak when restarting the storage multiple times in the same process. Fixed a bug where changing the fields of an entity type caused an exception. This was a regression bug from fixing a similar problem for another case in version 2.1. Now, both cases work correctly. All occurrences in user code of one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy have to be refactored to one.microstream.reference.Lazy. Modern IDEs provide a functionality to \"auto-import\" missing types or automatically \"organize imports\", so this should be resolved with a proverbial push of a button. Android support MicroStream is now Java-wise fully compatible with Android. Replaced all usages of java.util.File with java.nio.file.Path to allow using custom file implementations. Improved skipping functionality of Storers (see EmbeddedStorageManager#createStorer and Storer#skip). The class Lazy is now an interface to allow custom implementations. See Migration guide below. Fixed a few minor bugs in the skipping functionality of Storers. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after the storage was shut down. Fixed a bug where files remained locked after an exception in storage initialization. Enums defining an abstract method are now handled correctly. By default, all threads created by MicroStream now start with the prefix \"MicroStream-\". This can be customized by the new interface StorageThreadNameProvider. Fixed a NullPointerException in import. Fixed a bug that caused enums with a certain field layout to be loaded inconsistently. java.util.Locale is now persisted and created using Locale’s #toLanguageTag and #forLanguageTag. In the directory of an existing storage, in the TypeDictionary file (default name \"PersistenceTypeDictionary.ptd\"), all occurrences of \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy\" must be replaced with \"one.microstream.persistence.lazy.Lazy$Default\".","title":"Changelog","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"changelog","url":"/manual/intro/changelog.html","titles":[{"text":"8.0","hash":"_8_0","id":1},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features","id":2},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes","id":3},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide","id":4},{"text":"7.1","hash":"_7_1","id":5},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_2","id":6},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_2","id":7},{"text":"7.0","hash":"_7_0","id":8},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_3","id":9},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_3","id":10},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide_2","id":11},{"text":"6.1","hash":"_6_1","id":12},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_4","id":13},{"text":"6.0","hash":"_6_0","id":14},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_4","id":15},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_5","id":16},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"_migration_guide_3","id":17},{"text":"5.0.2","hash":"_5_0_2","id":18},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_6","id":19},{"text":"5.0.1","hash":"_5_0_1","id":20},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_7","id":21},{"text":"5.0","hash":"_5_0","id":22},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_5","id":23},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_8","id":24},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"5_0_migration-guide","id":25},{"text":"Artifacts and Packages","hash":"_artifacts_and_packages","id":26},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":27},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":28},{"text":"Storage","hash":"_storage","id":29},{"text":"4.1","hash":"_4_1","id":30},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_6","id":31},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_9","id":32},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"4_1_migration-guide","id":33},{"text":"4.0","hash":"_4_0","id":34},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_7","id":35},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_10","id":36},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"4_0_migration-guide","id":37},{"text":"3.0.1","hash":"_3_0_1","id":38},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_11","id":39},{"text":"3.0","hash":"_3_0","id":40},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_8","id":41},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_12","id":42},{"text":"Migration guide","hash":"3_0_migration-guide","id":43},{"text":"2.2","hash":"_2_2","id":44},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_9","id":45},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_13","id":46},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"2_2_migration-guide","id":47},{"text":"2.1","hash":"_2_1","id":48},{"text":"Features","hash":"_features_10","id":49},{"text":"Bugfixes","hash":"_bugfixes_14","id":50},{"text":"Migration Guide","hash":"_migration_guide_4","id":51}]},"260":{"id":260,"text":"You can find the MicroStream libraries in the Maven Central repository.

But the managing thread accessing it can. When an EmbeddedStorageManager is \"started\" it is actually just setup with all kinds of default and user-defined settings and definitions. What is actually \"started\" are the database managing threads that process storing and loading requests. // Setup the database manager and start the managing threads EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); Of course, for every start() method, there needs to be something like a shutdown() method. So there is in MicroStream: // Stop accessing the database storageManager.shutdown(); But is it really necessary to call shutdown? Should it be? What if there’s an error and the process stops without calling shutdown()? Will that cause the database to become inconsistent, corrupted, maybe even destroyed? The answer is: It wouldn’t be much of a database solution if a crash could cause any problem in the persisted data. MicroStream data-store is carefully designed in such a fashion that the process it runs in can simply vanish at any point in time and the persisted data will never be corrupted. This is surprisingly simple and reliable to solve: Whenever a .store() call returns, it is guaranteed that the data stored by it has been physically written to the underlying storage layer, usually a file system. Before that, there is no guarantee regarding written data at all. In fact, should the process die before the last byte has been written and secured, the next StorageManager initialization will recognize that and truncate the last partially written store. Either way, all the data that was guaranteed to be written will be consistently available after the next .start(). As a consequence, this safety mechanism makes an explicit .shutdown() call pretty much unnecessary. It doesn’t hurt, but it is effectively more-less the same as just calling System.exit(0);. The only time when an explicit shutdown is really needed is, if the database managing threads shall be stopped but the application itself keeps running. For example, it is perfectly valid to start the StorageManager, work with the database, then stop it, maybe change some configuration or copy files or something like that and then start it up again to continue working. In any other case, the shutdown method can be ignored and the live database can happily just be \"killed\" while running. It is specifically designed to withstand such a treatment. Any live MicroStream database basically consists of three major parts: A place where the persisted data is located. Usually a file system directory. The managing threads accessing (read and write) the persisted data. The EmbeddedStorageManager instance to use and control the database in the application. Apart from a lot of internal components (configuration, processing logic, housekeeping state, etc.), that’s all there is. There is nothing special or \"magic\" about it, no static state, no global registration in the JVM process or something like that. The consequence of this is: If two EmbeddedStorageManager instances are started, each one with a different location for its persistend data, then the application has two live databases! If three or ten or 100 are started, then that’s the number of live databases the application has. There is no limit and no conflict between different databases inside the same application process. The only important thing is that no two running StorageManagers can access the same data location.","title":"Application Life-Cycle","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"application-life-cycle","url":"/manual/storage/application-life-cycle.html","titles":[{"text":"Stopping or Crashing a Live Database","hash":"_stopping_or_crashing_a_live_database","id":1},{"text":"Multiple Databases","hash":"_multiple_databases","id":2}]},"264":{"id":264,"text":"Deleting data does not require performing explicit deleting actions like DELETE FROM table WHERE…​.

In line 6 the current storage’s content is printed. Line 7 assigns some data to the storage, replacing existing data if there is some. In line 8 everything gets stored. When using MicroStream, your entire database is accessed starting at a root instance. This instance is the root object of an object graph that gets persisted by the MicroStream storage logic. While the root instance can be of any type (for example just a collection or an array), it is a good idea to define an explicit root type specific for the application. In this simple example, it is a class called DataRoot, which wraps a single String. public class DataRoot { private String content; public DataRoot() { super(); } public String getContent() { return this.content; } public void setContent(final String content) { this.content = content; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Root: \" + this.content; } } For further information, see root instances. The following code is all that is required to setup a an application backed by a MicroStream database. The application’s convenience root instance is defined and an EmbeddedStorageManager instance, linked to the root, is created (and its database managing threads are started). This is a fully operational Java database application. // Application-specific root instance final DataRoot root = new DataRoot(); // Initialize a storage manager (\"the database\") with the given directory. final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start( root, // root object Paths.get(\"data\") // storage directory ); // Set content data to the root element, including the time to visualize // changes on the next execution. root.setContent(\"Hello World! @ \" + new Date()); // Store the modified root and its content. storageManager.storeRoot(); This call is all that is necessary to store data in the simplest case. storageManager.storeRoot() is a special case method that always stores the root object. If you want to store any other object than the root itself, just call storageManager.store(modifiedObject) Subsequent calls to storageManager.storeRoot() may not update the whole object graph! storageManager.storeRoot() uses the default lazy storing behavior.

It is comprised of mechanisms for cleaning up storage files, clearing unneeded cached data and recognizing deleted entities via garbage collection. Housekeeping is performed with a configurable time budget in configurable intervals to make sure it never interferes with the application’s work load too much (see housekeeping configuration). If new versions of an entity are stored or if entities become no longer reachable (meaning the become effectively deleted or \"garbage\" data), their older data is no longer needed. However, the byte sequences representing that old data still exist in the storage files. But since they will never be needed again, they become logical \"gaps\" in the storage files. Space that is occupied, but will never be read again. It might as well be all zeroes or not exist at all. Sadly, unwanted areas cannot simple by \"cut\" from files. Above all because that would ruin all file offsets coming after them. So with every newly stored version of an entity and every entity that is recognized as unreachable \"garbage\", a storage file consists more and more of useless \"gaps\" and less and less of actually used data. This makes the storage space less and less efficient. To prevent eventually ending up with a drive that is filled with useless bytes despite an actually not that big database, the files need to be \"cleaned up\" from time to time. To do this, the Housekeeping occasionally scans the storage files. If their \"payload\" ratio goes below the configured limit, the affected files will be retired: all data that belongs to still live entities is copied to a new file. Then the old file consists of 100% unneeded gap data and can safely be deleted. Which ratio value to set in the configuration is a matter of taste or, more precisely, depends on each individual application’s demands. A value of 1.0 (100%) means: only files with 100% payload, so no gaps at all, are acceptable. This means that for every store that contains at least one new version of an already existing entity, the corresponding storage file will contain the slightest gap, thus dropping below the demanded ratio of 100% and as a consequence, will be retired on the next occasion. This very aggressive cleanup strategy will keep the disc space usage at a perfect minimum, but at the cost of enormous amounts of copied data, since virtually every store will cause one or more storage files to be retired and their content be shifted into a new file. Respectively, a value of 0.0 (0%) means something like: \"Never care about gaps, just fill up the disc until it bursts.\" This keeps the disc write loads for the file cleanup at 0, but at the cost of rapidly eating up disc space. The best strategy most probably lies somewhere in between. Somewhere between 0.1 and 0.9 (10% and 90%). The default value is 0.75 (75%). So a storage file containing up to 25% of unused gap data is okay. Containing more gaps that 25% will cause a storage file to be retired. In addition to the payload ratio check, the file cleanup also retired files tha are too small or too big. For example: The application logic might commit a single store that is 100 MB in size. But the storage files are configured to be no larger than 10 MB (for example to keep a single file cleanup nice and fast). A single store is always written as a whole in the currently last storage file. The reason for this is to process the store as fast as possible and quickly return control to the application logic. When the housekeeping file cleanup scan encounters such an oversized file, it will retire it immediately by splitting it up across 10 smaller files and then deleting the oversized file. A similar logic applies to files that are too small. Upper and lower size bounds can be freely configured to arbitrary values. The defaults are 1 MB and 8 MB. To avoid repeated reads to storage files (which are incredibly expensive compared to just reading memory), data of once loaded entities is cached in memory. If an entity’s cached data is not requested again for a certain amount of time in relation to how much data is already cached, it is cleared from the cache to avoid unnecessarily consuming memory. The mechanism to constantly evaluate and clear cached data where applicable, is part of the housekeeping. The aggressiveness of this mechanism can be configured via the housekeeping configuration. In a reference-based (or graph-like) data paradigm, instances never have to be deleted explicitly. For example, there is no \"delete\" in the java language. There are only references. If those references are utilized correctly, deleting can be done fully automatically without any need for the developer to care about it. This is called \"garbage collection\". The concept is basically very simple: when the last reference to an instance is cut, that instance can never be accessed again. It becomes \"garbage\" that occupies memory with it data that is not needed any longer. To identify those garbage instances, all an algorithm (the \"garbage collector\") has to do is to follow every reference, starting at some defined root instance (or several) of a graph and mark every instance it encounters as \"reachable\". When it has no more unvisited instances in its queue, the marking is completed. Every instance that is not marked as reachable by then must be unreachable garbage and will be deleted from memory. Similar to the JVM’s garbage collection to optimize its memory consumption, MicroStream has a garbage collection of its own, but for the level of persistent storage space instead of memory space. Housekeeping can also be triggered manually from the StorageConnection . Related methods are: issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueCacheCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, entityEvaluator) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound) issueFileCheck(nanoTimeBudgetBound, fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullCacheCheck() issueFullCacheCheck(entityEvaluator) issueFullFileCheck() issueFullFileCheck(fileDissolvingEvaluator) issueFullGarbageCollection() issueGarbageCollection(nanoTimeBudget) All Housekeeping methods can be given a defined time budget or can be run until full completion.","title":"Housekeeping","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"housekeeping","url":"/manual/storage/housekeeping.html","titles":[{"text":"File cleanup:","hash":"_file_cleanup","id":1},{"text":"Cache cleanup","hash":"_cache_cleanup","id":2},{"text":"Garbage collection","hash":"_garbage_collection","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Housekeeping","hash":"_explicit_housekeeping","id":4}]},"267":{"id":267,"text":"MicroStream provides an API to import and export persisted data of the storage.

From a technical point of view it serves one purpose only: To fully or partially persist and restore a Java object graph in the simplest way possible for the user. MicroStream Data-Store is a storage engine, but no database management system (DBMS). Many features that typical DBMS provide have been left out on purpose. The reason is that those features exist to make a DBMS something of a server application platform of an \"old kind\" on top of its data store functionality: A standalone process with user management, connection management, session handling, often even with a programming language of its own, a querying interface (SQL), etc. Today, all of those server application features are already and much better handled by dedicated server applications (the \"new kind\"), implemented in a modern language like Java. They have their built-in user, connection and session management, the querying interface to the outside world are typically web services instead of SQL, etc. But those modern server applications still lack one important thing: an easy to use and technically efficient way to store and restore their application’s data. So a \"new kind\" server often uses an \"old kind\" server just to do the data storing. This comes at the price of catching all the overhead and problems of redundant user, connection and session management AND the outdated concepts and limitations of the old querying interface (SQL). Isn’t that very weird and frustratingly complicated? Why not simply include a modern data storing library in the modern server and be done with it? A storing library that perfectly fits the modern technology and brings in no redundant overhead or complication of a secondary outdated wannabe server process. This is exactly what MicroStream Data-Store is and the reason why it is intentionally not a DBMS but \"only\" a storage engine. One might think the easiest way to store and load data in Java would be Java’s built-in serialization. However, it turned out long ago to be very limited, making it hard, if not impossible, to be used as a replacement for a DBMS: Only complete object graphs can be stored and restored, which is unacceptable for all but very small databases. It is very inefficient in terms of storage size and performance. It does not handle changing class structures very well, basically forbidding classes of persisted entities to ever change or introducing massive manual effort to compensate. It cannot handle third-party classes that do not implement Serializable but cannot be changed. In short: The Java Serialization is not an acceptable data store solution and hence no valid replacement for those outdated DBMS. MicroStream Data-store is such a solution: It can persist, load or update object graphs partially and on-demand. It is very efficient both size- and performance-wise. It handles changing class structures by mapping data in the old structure to the current structure during loading; implicitly via internal heuristics or explicitly via a user-defined mapping strategy. It can automatically handle any Java constructs, only excluding those that are technically or reasonably not persistable (e.g. lambdas, proxies or instances with ties to JVM-internals like threads, etc.). MicroStream is what the Java Serialization should have been and it is the first and only really fitting data storing solution for modern applications, completely removing the need to attach a wannabe secondary server DBMS just to store data.","title":"Storage","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/storage/index.html","titles":[]},"269":{"id":269,"text":"The MicroStream engine takes care of persisting your object graph.

One value after another as a trivial byte stream. References between objects are mapped with unique numbers, called ObjectId, or short OID. + With both combined, byte streams and OIDs, an object graph can be stored in a simple and quick way, as well as loaded, as a whole or partially. But there is a small catch. Where does it start? What is the first instance or reference at startup? + Strictly speaking \"nothing\". That’s why at least one instance or a reference to an instance must be registered in a special way, so that the application has a starting point from where the object graph can be loaded. This is a \"Root Instance\". Same difference, another problem are instances which are references by constant fields in Java classes. These aren’t created when the records are loaded from the database, but by the JVM while loading the classes. Without special treatment, this would be a problem: The application, meaning the JVM or the JVM process, starts, the constant instances are created by the JVM, one or more of them are stored, then the application shuts down. The stored data of the constants are now stored with a certain OID in the database. The application starts again. The Constant instances are created again by the JVM. The data records are read by MicroStream. The problem is: How should the application know what values, which are stored with a certain OID, belong to which constant? The JVM created everything from scratch at startup and doesn’t know anything about OIDs. To resolve this, the constant instances must be registered, just like the entity graph’s root instance. Then MicroStream can associate the constant instances with the stored data via the OIDs. Constant instances can be thought of as JVM-created implicit root instances for the object graph. In both cases, root and constant instances, it is about registering special starting points for the object graph in order to load it correctly. For MicroStream, from a plain technical view, both cases don’t make a difference. In the most common cases, nothing at all. The default behavior is enough to get things going. By default, a single instance can be registered as the entity graph’s root, accessible via EmbeddedStorage.root(). + Therefore, this is already a fully fledged (although tiny) database application: // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // Set the entity (graph) as root storageManager.setRoot(\"Hello World\"); // Store root storageManager.storeRoot(); If you are working with Microstream technology in a multi-threaded environment, there are a few things you need to pay extra attention to. When using standard frameworks, you often work in a multi-threaded environment. If you are using the older JDBC approach, you create a copy of your data that you work with within a single thread, modify the data, and then save it back in a database trace. Microstream works with data directly, allowing it to achieve significantly better performance parameters. However, for developers, this means that any reading and writing to this shared object graph must be synchronized. To make it easier to use within your application, we have prepared a simple way for you to do so. XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.changeData(); storageManager.store(root); }); This approach will immediately provide you with several benefits: Any changes to your object graph will be synchronized, every other thread will see the current value. Avoid Deadlocks In principle, you prevent the object graph from being modified at the same time it is saved. The simple default approach has its limits when the application defines an explicit root instance that must be updated/filled from the database directly during database initialization. Something like this: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage.start(); // root must be filled at this point... but how? root.printAllMyEntities(); To solve this, a custom root instance can be directly registered at the database setup. In the simplest case, is just has to be passed to .start();: // Empty application-specific root, to be filled during start() MyApplicationRoot root = new MyApplicationRoot(); // Start the database manager with a reference to the application's root. EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // root is \"magically\" filled at this point. (Yay!) root.printAllMyEntities(); Internally, the two concepts (default root and custom root) and handled by different mechanisms. This can be seen from the two different methods storageManager.defaultRoot(); storageManager.customRoot(); The simplified method storageManager.root(); automatically chooses the variant that is used. Since neither of those three methods can know the concrete type of the root instance (and adding a type parameter just for that would have been a complication overkill), they all can only be typed to return Object. So, to avoid annoying and dangerous casts, it is best to keep a direct reference to a custom root instance as shown in the code snippet above. Likewise, storageManager.storeRoot(); works for both variants, so there is no need to worry about how to store which one. Subsequent calls to storageManager.storeRoot() may not update the whole object graph! storageManager.storeRoot() uses the default lazy storing behavior.","title":"Root Instances","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"root-instances","url":"/manual/storage/root-instances.html","titles":[{"text":"What Must Be Done in the Application?","hash":"_what_must_be_done_in_the_application","id":1},{"text":"Shared Mutable Data","hash":"_shared_mutable_data","id":2},{"text":"Synchronize access to shared mutable data","hash":"_synchronize_access_to_shared_mutable_data","id":3},{"text":"Custom Root Instances","hash":"_custom_root_instances","id":4}]},"271":{"id":271,"text":"MicroStream comes with a CDI extension which allows accessing the functionality of MicroStream through the usage of a few annotations.

After the StorageManager is created, the CDI beans that implement one.microstream.integrations.cdi.types.config.StorageManagerInitializer are called. You have the opportunity to perform actions on the StorageManager or root object. Following rules apply to the StorageManager that is passed to the initialize method of the interface. The StorageManager is already started unless you specified the configuration value one.microstream.autoStart=false. If you have used the @Storage annotation on a class, the StorageManager is already associated with an instance of that class as the Root object. There is a second option to configure and retrieve the StorageManager, and it makes use of the MicroStream functionality to read the configuration from any file. @Inject @ConfigProperty(name = \"one.microstream.ini\") private StorageManager storageManager; The above construct makes use of the MicroProfile Config functionality that you convert the value of the key one.microstream.ini and convert it into a StorageManager. The value of the key is expected to point to an existing file. The formats XML, INI, and properties are supported. The StorageManager is also fully configured and started just as you would use it when using the first option of configuration. If you define it multiple times, within different beans for example, you always receive the same instance of the StorageManager when you specify the same value for the name member of the @ConfigProperty annotation. This way, you can define and use multiple _StorageManager_s within your application. The customizer and initializer features described earlier as CDI beans implementing a specific interface,are also available when you use the MicroProfile Config annotation (@ConfigProperty). Since you can define multiple StorageManager_s this way, you can distinguish between them based on the _database name. The database name can be set by using the following property within the configuration file (example makes use of the properties format, but it is also supported in the other formats) database-name=theName If this property is not specified, the value of the MicroProfile config key (used within the name member of @ConfigProperty) is used. Within the customizer and initializer you can use this to perform the required actions based on the instance you receive. EmbeddedStorageFoundation.getDataBaseName(); StorageManager.databaseName(); The root object can be indicated by using the @Storage annotation on the class. This annotation converts the POJO into a CDI bean (there is no need to use any scope-defining annotation) with Application Scope. This is only supported when you inject the StorageManager without making use of the MicroProfile Config @ConfigProperty annotation. Besides converting it into a CDI bean, any field injection within this class is also resolved. The integration also defines the instance of the class that is created as the root object (StorageManager.setRoot()) and stores the initial value (StorageManager.storeRoot()) when storageManager does not have a root object assigned yet (this happens only the very first time when you start up your application and the storage doesn’t contain any data yet) The POJO must have a (default) no-argument constructor so that the integration can create an instance of it. You can only annotate 1 class with the @Storage annotation, if you have marked multiple, the deployment of your application will fail at the CDI validation phase.","title":"CDI Extension","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"cdi","url":"/manual/misc/integrations/cdi.html","titles":[{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":1},{"text":"Root object","hash":"_root_object","id":2}]},"272":{"id":272,"text":"The Helidon integration for MicroStream ships with the official Helidon releases, and is hosted at Oracle’s Github repository.

It is available within this artifact: pom.xml one.microstream microstream-integrations-spring-boot 08.00.00-MS-GA Official Spring Boot site: https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot The integration requires Spring Boot 2.x (with version 2.1.0.RELEASE being the minimal supported one). If you are running Spring Boot 3, use the following dependency in your project: pom.xml one.microstream microstream-integrations-spring-boot3 08.00.00-MS-GA The migration from version 2 to 3 doesn’t require any code changes related to the MicroStream integration classes. Internally, the integration makes now use of the AutoConfiguration option (where the Spring Boot 2 integration code makes use of the Spring Factories config file) Since version 8.0.0, the StorageManager that is instantiated by the integration is also started where the previous version of the integration did not start the manager. You can have the old behaviour of a StorageManager that is not started by specifying the config value one.microstream.auto-start=false. The configuration of the StorageManager can be done using key/value pairs that are provided by Spring Boot external Configuration. The configuration keys must be prefixed by one.microstream one.microstream.storage-directory=/opt/data/microstream one.microstream.channel-count=2 The list of all MicroStream configuration properties and their meaning are listed on our documentation page. The configuration values are handled using the typesafe configuration approach, and you can read these values by accessing the MicrostreamConfigurationProperties Spring bean. You can either create a StorageManager yourself from an EmbeddedStorageFoundation Spring bean or access a fully configured one through the StorageManager Spring bean. Be aware that since both share the same configuration values, if you create and start a StorageManager from EmbeddedStorageFoundation, it will conflict with the one from the StorageManager Spring bean. When you use the EmbeddedStorageFoundation Spring bean, don’t access the StorageManager bean. The EmbeddedStorageFoundation one is ideal if your Spring application is performing one-of tasks like for example Batch processing. The other one is suited in most cases and the StorageManager can be customized and initialized before it is actually used. Also, note that when using the feature of having the Root object as Spring Bean already creates and initializes the StorageManager. The StorageManager configuration can be customized by Spring beans that implement the interface one.microstream.integrations.spring.boot.types.config.EmbeddedStorageFoundationCustomizer. The customize method is called with an EmbeddedStorageFoundation which allows you to fully customize the StorageManager that will be created. You can for example, add the specific Type Handlers for JDK 8 as described on the documentation. After the StorageManager is created, the Spring beans that implement one.microstream.integrations.spring.boot.types.config.StorageManagerInitializer are called. You have the opportunity to perform actions on the StorageManager or root object. Following rules apply to the StorageManager that is passed to the initialize method of the interface. The StorageManager is already started unless you specified the configuration value one.microstream.auto-start=false. If you have used the @Storage annotation on a class, the StorageManager is already associated with an instance of that class as the Root object. The root object can be indicated by using the @Storage annotation on the class. This annotation converts the POJO into a Spring bean (The annotation is a Spring Qualifier that makes the class also a Component). Besides converting it into a Spring bean, any field or setter injection within this class is also resolved. Please note that constructor injection is not supported and will result in an error indicating that the class has not a no-argument constructor. The integration also defines the instance of the class that is created as the root object (StorageManager.setRoot()) and stores the initial value (StorageManager.storeRoot()) when storageManager does not have a root object assigned yet (this happens only the very first time when you start up your application and the storage doesn’t contain any data yet) You can only annotate 1 class with the @Storage annotation, if you have marked multiple, the creation of the Storage Spring bean will fail with a BeansException. When using the @Storage functionality, you as a developer should not change the root object of the StorageManager yourself anymore as that will lead to conflicts and mismatches between the Spring bean created for the Root object and your newly set instance on the StorageManager. When using @Storage, the Root initialization when there is no data in the data storage yet, happens asynchronously from the StorageManager initialization. This means that your code that uses the StorageManager bean can retrieve/operate on a null root when initialization is still in progress. As of version 8.0.0, the integration support multiple StorageManagers. Within Spring (Boot) you can define multiple beans that implement the same interface by assigning it a certain label with the @Qualifier annotation. Using the same principle, you can define multiple StorageManagers. And in this case, also the Root object (through the @Storage annotation) and StorageManagerInitializer and EmbeddedStorageFoundationCustomizer concepts are supported. Since we cannot know which qualifier (label) you want to use for your different _StorageManager_s, the Spring Boot integration cannot create the beans without a little help/configuration from the developer. You can define the StorageManager you need and assign through the following Configuration Bean. @Configuration public class DefineStorageManagers { private final StorageManagerProvider provider; public DefineStorageManagers(StorageManagerProvider provider) { this.provider = provider; } @Bean @Qualifier(\"green\") public EmbeddedStorageManager getGreenManager() { return provider.get(DatabaseColor.GREEN.getName()); } @Bean @Qualifier(\"red\") public EmbeddedStorageManager getRedManager() { return provider.get(DatabaseColor.RED.getName()); } } The StorageManagerProvider is a helper bean from the Spring Boot integration that can fully initialise the StorageManager and the root by providing a qualifier label. The qualifier label is used as prefix to look for the appropriate configuration values. one.microstream.red.storage-directory=red-db one.microstream.red.channel-count=2 one.microstream.green.storage-directory=green-db one.microstream.green.channel-count=1 A StorageManagerInitializer`and `EmbeddedStorageFoundationCustomizer implementation can check which instance it received by looking at the database name property which reflects the Qualifier label that you used. @Override public void initialize(final StorageManager storageManager) { if (!\"red\".equals(storageManager.databaseName())) { // This customizer operates on the Red database only return; } /// Perform the required initialization. } Another option is that you annotate the class with @Qualifier and the Initializer or Customizer is only called for items with matching qualifier label in that case. Instead of 2 named StorageManager s through a Qualifier, you can also use one default (since we define a @Primary annotated StorageManager within the integration) and one that you define yourself as we have done above. In that case, the configuration keys that you need to use are one.microstream. and one.microstream. and the database name for the default one is Primary. By default, Spring creates all singleton beans at the start of the application. The Spring beans defined by the MicroStream integration, like StorageManager and Storage root bean, are singletons. So they are created at startup which means that for example when you are using a database as a storage target, the database must be available and accessible when the application starts up. When this is not desired, because the database might be only available when the user request arrives and not at application startup, you can use the Provider option. Add the Jakarta Inject dependency to your project jakarta.inject jakarta.inject-api 1.0 And use injection based on the Provider and not the actual class itself. private final Provider storageManagerProvider; public UserRepository(Provider storageManagerProvider) { this.storageManagerProvider = storageManagerProvider; } When you need to access the StorageManager Spring bean, you perform storageManagerProvider.get() statement, and only at that point the StorageManager is created as a Spring bean. This allows you to delay the creation until the first user request. MicroStream Spring module supports standard Spring logging, so you can add this into your config: logging.level.one.microstream=debug to obtain all MicroStream configuration keys: 2021-08-23 15:16:02.979 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : Microstream configuration items: 2021-08-23 15:16:02.979 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-filesystem.sql.postgres.password : xxxxx 2021-08-23 15:16:02.994 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-filesystem.sql.postgres.data-source-provider : one.microstream.test.spring.MyDataSourceProvider 2021-08-23 15:16:02.994 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-directory : microstream_storage 2021-08-23 15:16:02.994 DEBUG 18469 --- [ main] o.m.spring.MicrostreamConfiguration : storage-filesystem.sql.postgres.user : postgres Key values containing \"password\" are replaced by \"xxxxx\".","title":"Spring Boot Integration","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"spring-boot","url":"/manual/misc/integrations/spring-boot.html","titles":[{"text":"Breaking changes","hash":"_breaking_changes","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"_configuration","id":2},{"text":"Root object","hash":"_root_object","id":3},{"text":"Multiple Managers","hash":"_multiple_managers","id":4},{"text":"Late initialization","hash":"_late_initialization","id":5},{"text":"Logging","hash":"_logging","id":6}]},"276":{"id":276,"text":"Loading data can be done in two ways, eager and Lazy.

When called, the reference held in the Lazy Reference is removed and only the ID is kept so that the instance can be reloaded when needed. Important background knowledge: However, such a clear does not mean that the referenced instance immediately disappears from memory. That’s the job of the garbage collector of the JVM. The reference is even registered in another place, namely in a global directory (Swizzle Registry), in which each known instance is registered with its ObjectId in a bijective manner. This means: if you clear such a reference, but shortly thereafter the Lazy Reference is queried again, probably nothing has to be loaded from the database, but simply the reference from the Swizzle Registry is restored. Nevertheless, the Swizzle Registry is not a memory leak, because it references the instances only via WeakReference. In short, if an instance is only referenced as \"weak,\" the JVM GC will still clean it up. So that the Lazy References do not have to be managed manually, but the whole goes automatically, there is the following mechanism: Each Lazy instance has a lastTouched timestamp. Each .get() call sets it to the current time. This will tell you how long a Lazy Reference has not been used, i.e. if it is needed at all. The LazyReferenceManager audits this. It is enabled by default, with a timeout of 1,000,000 milliseconds, which is about 15 minutes. A custom manager can be set easily, which should happen before a storage is started.

Of course, it’s not really about the technical implementation of procrastination, but about efficiency: why bloat the limited RAM with stuff before you even need it? Classic example: The application has self-contained data areas that contain a large amount of data. The data for an area is not loaded if the area is not worked at all. Instead, you only load a tiny amount of \"head data\" for each area (name or other for displaying purposes) and the actual data only when the application really needs it. E.g. fiscal years with hundreds of thousands or millions of sales. One million revenue records for 2010, one million for 2011, for 2012, etc. In 2019, most of the time only 2019 and 2018 will be needed. The previous few, and the year 2000 sales are not of great interest anymore. Therefore: load data only when needed. Super efficient. For example let’s say the app \"MyBusinessApp\" has a root instance class, looking like this: public class MyBusinessApp { // ... private HashMap businessYears = new HashMap<>(); // ... } The business year hold the turnovers: public class BusinessYear { // ... private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); // ... } This approach would be a problem: During initialization, the root instance would be loaded, from there its HashMap with all BusinessYear instances, each with its ArrayList and thus all conversions. For all years. 20 years of approximately 1 million sales makes 20 million entities, which are pumped directly into the RAM at the start. It does not matter if someone needs it or not. We don’t want it that way. It would be nice if you could simply add a \"lazy\" to the turnover list. And that’s exactly how it works: public class BusinessYear { // ... private Lazy> turnovers = ...; // we will get to that // ... } And bingo, the turnovers are now loaded lazily. Of course, this is no longer an ArrayList field, which is now magically loaded lazy, but this is now a Lazy field and the instances of this type are typed generically to ArrayList . Lazy is just a simple class whose instances internally hold an ID and a reference to the actual thing (here the ArrayList instance). If the internal reference is zero, the reserved ID is used to reload it. If it is not null, it is simply returned. So just a reference intermediate instance. Similar to the JDK’s WeakReference, just not JVM-weak, but storage-lazy. What do you have to do now to get the actual ArrayList instance? ArrayList turnovers = this.turnovers.get(); Just as with WeakReference, or simply as one would expect from a reference intermediate type in general: a simple get method. The .get() call reloads the data as needed. But you do not want to mess around with that yourself. No \"SELECT bla FROM turnovers WHERE ID =\" + this.turnovers.getId(). Since you want to program your application you don' t have to mess around with low-level database ID-loading stuff. That’s what the MicroStream Code does internally. You do not even need to access the ID, you just have to say \"get!\". That’s it. There are different strategies, what you write here. Analogous to the code example before it would be simply: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(new ArrayList<>()); So always a new ArrayList instance, wrapped in a Lazy instance. If the actual ArrayList reference should be null at first, it works the same way: private Lazy> turnovers = Lazy.Reference(null); The this.turnovers.get() also just always returns null. Completely transparent. But you could also do this: private Lazy> turnovers = null; If there is no list, then you do not make any intermediate reference instance for any list. A separate instance for null is indeed a bit …​ meh. But that has a nasty problem elsewhere: this.turnovers.get() does not work then. Because NullPointerException. Anytime you need to write this here, the readability of code is not exactly conducive: return this.turnovers == null ? null : this.turnovers.get(); But there is a simple solution: Just move this check into a static utility method. Just like that: return Lazy.get(this.turnovers); This is the same .get(), just with a static null-check around it. This always puts you on the safe side. For Lazy Loading, simply wrap Lazy<> around the actual field and then call .get() or maybe better Lazy.get(...). It’s as simple as that. The full example can be found on GitHub. Why do you have to replace your actual instance with a lazy loading intermediate instance and fiddle around with generics? Why is not something like this: @Lazy private ArrayList turnovers = new ArrayList<>(); Put simply: If it were just that it would be bare Java bytecode for accessing an ArrayList. There would be no way for a middleware library to get access and look it up and perhaps reload it. What’s written there is an ArrayList reference. There is no lazy anymore. Either, the instance is null, or it is not null. If you wanted to reach in there, you would have to start with bytecode manipulation. Technically possible, but something you really don’t want in your application. So there must always be some form of intermediary. Hibernate solves this through its own collection implementations that do lazy loading internally. Although the lazy loading is nicely hidden in some way (or not, if you need an annotation for that), it also comes with all sorts of limitations. You can only use interfaces instead of concrete classes for collections. At first, the instance is not the one you dictate, the code becomes non-transparent and difficult to debug, you have to use a collection, even if it’s just a single instance, and so on. You want to be able to write anything you want and you want full insight and control (debugability, etc.) over the code. All this can be done with the tiny Lazy Interim Reference class. No restrictions, no incomprehensible \"magic\" under the hood (proxy instances and stuff) and also usable for individual instances.","title":"Lazy Loading","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/index.html","titles":[{"text":"What about the \"…​\" ?","hash":"_what_about_the","id":1},{"text":"In Short","hash":"_in_short","id":2},{"text":"Side Note","hash":"_side_note","id":3}]},"285":{"id":285,"text":"New functionality since MicroStream v8.0 A List, Map, or Set is a single entity within MicroStream. So this means that all data are loaded at once into memory. This can be an issue if you have a very large collection, like a list with several millions of Customers. That is why we recommend splitting up large lists using an indexing strategy like a HashMap that contains a Lazy list of data as value. Or when more advanced functionality is required, you can make use of an Apache Lucene index that efficiently determines which data needs to be loaded. The Lazy collections that are added to the library can help you to maintain a larger block of data in a more memory-efficient way. The implementation might need to load and unload data (when there is not enough memory) so access time to the data might be slightly increased. No additional configuration is required to make use of these Lazy Collections. The Binary Handlers to correctly write and read the Lazy Collections to and from the data storage are already configured by default. When you need to instantiate an instance, you can just call the default constructor. The instance you receive implements the standard Java collection interface that you expect based on the name of the class. new LazyArrayList(); new LazyHashSet(); new LazyHashMap(); The default constructor takes a value of 1000 items in each segment. This is not a hard limit since various factors, like the hash collision with a Map, can result in the fact that more elements are maintained in a segment. You can specify the number of items that should be maintained by specifying this value as a constructor parameter. Note that small values, like smaller than 100, or large values like 1_000_000 and more might negatively impact the performance. As mentioned, the implementation stores the data in different segments which are lazily operated. Initially, at the startup of the StorageManager, the data is not yet loaded into memory and your object graph. When accessing the values, it loads the required segments to fulfill your request. Depending on how you access the data, it might be that all segments need to be loaded. Since they behave like Lazy objects, they can be unloaded by the Garbage collector if needed when the memory consumption of your Java application is high. Some aspects of the implementations The size property is cached, so calling for the amount of data in the collection doesn’t need to load the segments. Accessing the LazyHashMap by a key value will load at maximum log2(n) segments when the implementation uses n segments since the search is implemented as btree.","title":"Lazy collections","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"lazy-collections","url":"/manual/storage/loading-data/lazy-loading/lazy-collections.html","titles":[{"text":"Background","hash":"background","id":1},{"text":"Configuration","hash":"config","id":2},{"text":"Using","hash":"use","id":3},{"text":"Internals","hash":"_internals","id":4}]},"286":{"id":286,"text":"For convenience MicroStream provides Null-safe static access methods for lazy references.

This also allows the actual data instance to be immutable, while at the same time leaving referential integrity of an entity graph intact. MicroStream provides ready-to-use logic layers for: Logging Versioning While the layers admittedly introduce considerable technical complexity and runtime overhead, this concept is a production ready solution for nearly all requirements regarding cross cutting concerns and aspects. To use this concept in your code, there need to be at least implementations for the entity’s identity and data. Let’s say the entity looks like this: public interface Person extends Entity { public String firstName(); public String lastName(); } There needs to be a identity class: public class PersonEntity extends EntityLayerIdentity implements Person { protected PersonEntity() { super(); } @Override protected Person entityData() { return (Person)super.entityData(); } @Override public final String firstName() { return this.entityData().firstName(); } @Override public final String lastName() { return this.entityData().lastName(); } } And a data class: public class PersonData extends EntityData implements Person { private final String firstName; private final String lastName ; protected PersonData(final Person entity, final String firstName, final String lastName ) { super(entity); this.firstName = firstName; this.lastName = lastName ; } @Override public String firstName() { return this.firstName; } @Override public String lastName() { return this.lastName; } } A lot of code to write to get an entity with two properties! But don’t worry, there is a code generator for that. An annotation processor to be precise. The only code you have to provide are the entity interfaces, all the other stuff will be generated. Just add the annotation processor type one.microstream.entity.codegen.EntityProcessor to your compiler configuration. That’s it.

If we update the entity a few times, we will see how the versioning layer works. In this case we use an auto-incrementing Long as key. PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Smith\"); PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Archer\"); PersonUpdater.setLastName(john, \"Bennett\"); john.lastName() // now returns \"Bennett\" If you want to access older versions use the context: versionContext.versions(john).get(1L); // -> \"John Smith\" To limit the amount of preserved versions, a cleaner can be utilized: EntityVersionCleaner versionCleaner = EntityVersionCleaner.AmountPreserving(10); EntityVersionContext versionContext = EntityVersionContext.AutoIncrementingLong(cleaner); This will keep only the last ten versions of the person. Additionally to number keys, timestamps can be used as well.

So you can control versioning for multiple entities at once, or even for the hole entity graph. The auto-incrementing contexts take care of the key creation. If you need to control it by yourself, use the mutable context. But be aware that you have to set the version before updating any data, otherwise the current one will be overwritten.

All types in the public API are, whenever possible, interfaces. This offers the best possibilities to extend or exchange parts of the engine. A good ways to enrich a type with features, is the wrapper (decorator) pattern. For example, let’s say we want to add logging to the PersistenceStoring's store(object) method. PersistenceStoring.java public interface PersistenceStoring { public long store(Object instance); public long[] storeAll(Object... instances); public void storeAll(Iterable instances); public void storeSelfStoring(SelfStoring storing); } Conventionally it would be done that way: A new type, implementing the original interface, would be handed over the wrapped instance, all interface methods have to be implemented and delegated. And in the single method, we wanted to add functionality; the actual implementation of the logging is done. public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } This produces a lot of overhead. In this case, three methods are just boilerplate code to delegate the calls to the wrapped instance. A common solution for that is to create an abstract base wrapper type for the designated interface, and to reuse it whenever needed. public abstract class BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring implements PersistenceStoring { private final PersistenceStoring wrapped; public BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring(final PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(); this.wrapped = wrapped; } @Override public long store(final Object instance) { return this.wrapped.store(instance); } @Override public long[] storeAll(final Object... instances) { return this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeAll(final Iterable instances) { this.wrapped.storeAll(instances); } @Override public void storeSelfStoring(final SelfStoring storing) { this.wrapped.storeSelfStoring(storing); } } And then, based on that, the implementation of the logger type would look like this: public class PersistenceStoringWithLogging extends BaseWrapperPersistenceStoring { public PersistenceStoringWithLogging(PersistenceStoring wrapped) { super(wrapped); } @Override public long store(Object instance) { Logger.getLogger(PersistenceStoring.class.getName()) .info(\"Object stored: \" + instance); return super.store(instance); } } That’s better. No more boilerplate code. Just overwrite the methods you want to extend. The only work left is, to generate the base wrapper types. One way is to let your IDE generate the wrapper or delegation code. Disadvantage of that is, it has to be redone every time your interfaces change. A code generator, which does it automatically would be nice. And that’s what the base module brings along.

This is useful to optimize the performance for storing complex objects or in the rare case that it is not possible to store a type with the default type handlers. There are two strategies for a simplified type handler implementation. Implementing a class that extends CustomBinaryHandler and defines a sequence of BinaryFields via the #Field~ static pseudo-constructor methods. Everything else like setting the name, calculating the binary offsets, etc. is then done implicitly via reflection. Example on GitHub This example implements a custom type handler for the java.awt.image.BufferedImage class. Instead of storing the rather complex object structure of that class the image is serialized as PNG image format using javax.imageio.ImageIO into a byte array. This byte array is then stored by MicroStream. The custom type handler must be registered in the CustomTypeHandlerRegistry to enable it: EmbeddedStorageManager storage = EmbeddedStorage .Foundation(WORKINGDIR) .onConnectionFoundation(f -> f.registerCustomTypeHandlers(new CustomBufferedImageHandler()) ) .start(ROOT); Implementing a class can be skipped altogether by using the method Binary#TypeHandler and passing the BinaryFields directly. Registering such a generically created TypeHandler is not required, either, since Version 3 of MicroStream brought a solution to just define a static method in the entity class that will be recognized and used by MicroStream. The following is a simple technical example on how a custom binary handler can be easily defined and technically leveraged to optimize storage behavior.

Contact.java (old) public class Contact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; } Contact.java (new) public class Contact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNode ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } Console Output ---------- Legacy type mapping required for legacy type 1000055:Contact to current type 1000056:Contact Fields: java.lang.String Contact#firstname -1.000 ----> java.lang.String Contact#firstname java.lang.String Contact#name -0.750 ----> java.lang.String Contact#lastname java.lang.String Contact#email -0.708 ----> java.lang.String Contact#emailAddress java.lang.String Contact#note -0.636 ----> java.lang.String Contact#supportNode [***new***] PostalAddress Contact#postalAddress int Contact#age -1.000 ----> int Contact#age java.lang.Object Contact#link [discarded] --- Write 'y' to accept the mapping. The fields in the Contact entity class have been renamed, reordered, one was removed, one is new. What the heuristic is doing now is something like this: String firstname is equal in both classes, so it has to be the same, pretty much as int age. name and lastname is pretty similar, type is the same too. If there is nothing better for the two, they probably belong together. Same with the other two fields. In the end, the ominous link and postalAddress remain. The heuristic can not make sense of that, so it assumes that one thing falls away and the other one is added. In this particular example, that worked perfectly. Well done, heuristic. But: Just as people can make mistakes in estimating similarities (\"I would have thought …​\"), even programs can make mistakes as soon as they logically go on thin ice. There is nothing more with absolute correctness that you actually know from (bug-free) software. Such a similarity matching will be correct in the most cases, but sometimes it will also fall by the wayside. Example: perhaps only PostalAddress instances were referenced in the application under link and the two fields would actually be the same, only now properly typed and named. How should heuristics know that? Nobody could know that either, if he is not privy to the details of the concrete application. That’s why Legacy Type Mapping has two mechanisms that prevent things from going wrong: A callback interface is used to create the desired mapping result: PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor Optionally, an explicit mapping can be specified, which is then preferred to the heuristic approach. If you do not want that, you can simply set another resultor. Like in this example each suspected mapping is submitted once to the user for control in the console. This is done with the InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor. Maybe even one, where the user can \"rewire\" the mapping itself, write out the mapping, and then return an appropriate result. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(myDataDir); foundation.getConnectionFoundation().setLegacyTypeMappingResultor( InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() ) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(myRoot).start(); All you need is two columns of strings: from old to new. By default MicroStream uses a CSV file, but you can also write something else. In the end, a lot of string pairs for \"old → new\" mappings have to come into the program somewhere. The concept is simple: If there are two strings, this is interpreted as a mapping from an old thing to a new thing. If the second value is missing, it is interpreted as an old thing to be deleted. Missing the first value, then it’s as a new thing. Why call it \"thing\"? Because this applies to several structural elements: Constant identifier Class names Field names Example: count; articleCount means: the field named earlier count is called articleCount in the current version of the class. count; means: the early field count should be ignored during the mapping. More specifically, the values ​​of this field per record. ;articleCount means, this is a newly added field, DO NOT try to match it with anything else heuristically. You can also mix explicit mapping and heuristics. Only explicitly specify so many changes until the analysis gets the rest right by itself. That means you never have to specify the annoying trivial cases explicitly. Only the tricky ones. Usually, nothing should be necessary at all, or maybe a view indications at most to avoid mishaps. However, those who strictly prefer to make any change explicitly, instead of trusting a \"guessing\" software, can also do that. No problem. For class names, the three variants map, add and remove are somewhat tricky in meaning: Map is just old → new, same as with fields. To make an entry for a new class doesn’t make sense. It’s covered by the new class itself. You can do it, but it has no effect. Marking a removed class as deleted makes no sense either, except one special case. It is not required to specify the fields mapping of mapped classes if the mapping heuristic can do a correct field mapping. Especially if classes have been renamed only. Classes are simply referred to by their full qualified class name: com.my.app.entities.Order In some cases you need to specify the exact Version of the class, then the TypeId has to be prepended: 1012345:com.my.app.entities.Order Mapping from old to new: com.my.app.entities.Order;com.my.app.entities.OrderImplementation For fields it’s a bit more complex. To unambiguously refer a field, the full qualified name of its defining class has to be used. com.my.app.entities.Order#count;com.my.app.entities.Order#articleCount The # is based on official Java syntax, like e.g. in JavaDoc. If inheritance is involved, which must be uniquely resolved (each class in the hierarchy can have a field named \"count\"), you must also specify the declaring class. Like this: com.my.app.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#count; ⤦ com.my.App.entities.Order#com.my.app.entities.ArticleHolder#articleCount A simple example: OldContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class OldContact { String name ; String firstname; int age ; String email ; String note ; Object link ; // to be discarded } NewContact.java package com.my.app.entities; public class NewContact { String firstname ; // moved String lastname ; // renamed String emailAddress ; // renamed String supportNote ; // renamed PostalAddress postalAddress; // new int age ; // moved } refactorings.csv old current com.my.app.entities.OldContact com.my.app.entities.NewContact com.my.app.entities.OldContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.NewContact#firstname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#name com.my.app.entities.NewContact#lastname com.my.app.entities.OldContact#email com.my.app.entities.NewContact#emailAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#note com.my.app.entities.NewContact#supportNote com.my.app.entities.NewContact#postalAddress com.my.app.entities.OldContact#age com.my.app.entities.NewContact#age com.my.app.entities.OldContact#link EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(dataDir); foundation.setRefactoringMappingProvider( Persistence.RefactoringMapping(Paths.get(\"refactorings.csv\")) ); EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = foundation.createEmbeddedStorageManager(root).start(); So far so good, all classes and fields are getting mapped, automatically or manually. But what about the data? How are the values getting transformed from old to new? Technically speaking it’s done fully automatic. But there are some interesting questions: What if the primitive types changes? What if primitives change to references and vice versa? How fast is it? Let’s say int to float. Just to copy the four bytes would yield wrong results. It has to be converted, like float floatValue = (float)intValue; Can it be done? Yes, fully automatic. The class BinaryValueTranslators does the job for you, it has a converter function from each primitive to another. Currently MicroStream supports conversion between primitives and their wrapper types, and vice versa. When converting a wrapper to a primitive, null is converted to 0. If you need special conversions between object types, you can add custom BinaryValueSetter for that, see customizing. How fast is that? The type analysis happens only once during initialization. If no exception occurs, the Legacy Type Mapping is ready-configured for each necessary type and will then only be called if required. For normal entity classes that are parsed by reflection, legacy type mapping loading is just as fast as a normal load. An array of such value translator functions is put together once and they are run through each time they are loaded. With legacy mapping, only the order and the target offsets are different, but the principle is the same as with normal loading. For custom handlers an intermediate step is necessary: ​​First put all the old values ​​together in an order that the custom handler expects and then read the binary data normally, as if loading a record in the current format. That’s necessary because MicroStream can’t know what such a custom handler does internally. If someone ever uses such a custom handler, the small detour is not likely to be noticeable in terms of performance. And if it should be the case and it has a negative effect on the productive operation: No problem, because: Of course you can also write a custom legacy type handler. It would run at full speed even with tricky special cases. Of course there is the possibility, as always, of intervening in the machinery massively with customizing. If you need the highest possible performance for some cases, or for logging / debugging, or anyway: Register any value translator implementations. In the simplest case this is 1 line of code, so do not worry. Being able to specify refactoring mapping in a different way than a CSV file is another example. You can even customize (extend or replace) the strategy that is looked up in refactoring mapping. Furthermore, you can also replace the heuristic logic with your own. This is easier than it sounds. This is just a primitive little interface (PersistenceMemberSimilator) and the default implementation thereof calls e.g. just a Levenshtein algorithm for names. You can certainly do that 10 times more clever. Or \"more appropriate\" for a particular application or programming style. E.g. utilize annotations. The basic statement is: If there is a problem somewhere, whether with the heuristic or a special case request or performance problem loading a gazillion entities all at once, or if there is a need for debugging in depth or something like that: do not panic. Most likely, this is easily possible with a few lines of code. Customizing examples You can not just mark classes as deleted. As long as there are records of a certain type in the database, the corresponding class must also exist so that the instances from the database can be loaded into the application. If there are no more records, then that means that there are only a few bytes of orphaned description in the type dictionary, but nobody cares. Is it possible to delete it by hand (or rather not, there are good reasons against it) or you can just ignore it and leave it there forever. In both cases, you must not mark a class as deleted. Now the special case: In the entity graph (root instances and all recursively reachable instances from there) all references to instances of a certain type are filled in. It’s done by the application logic or possibly by a specially written script. That is, all instances of this type are unreachable. No instance is available, no instance can ever be reloaded. This means that the type is \"deleted\" from the database at the logical level. One does not have to register anywhere, that is implicitly just like that. You can actually delete the corresponding Java class from the application project because it will never be needed again during the loading process at runtime. So far so good. There is only one problem: even if the instances are never logically accessible again: the data records are still around in the database files. The initialization scans over all database files, registers all entities, collects all occurring TypeIds and ensures for every TypeId that there is a TypeHandler for it. If necessary, a LegacyTypeHandler with mapping, but still: there must be a TypeHandler for each TypeId. And a TypeHandler needs a runtime type. That is, ass-backwards, over records that are logically already deleted, but only physically still lying around, now it is again enforced that the erasable entity class must be present. Bummer. One can prevent this: there is a \"cleanup\" function in the database management logic, which cleans up all logical gaps in the database files (actually copies all non-gaps into a new file and thus deletes the old file altogether). You would have to call it, then all physical occurrences of the unreachable records disappear and you could easily delete the associated class. But that is annoying. That is why it makes sense for these cases - and only for them - to do the following: If you as a developer are absolutely sure that no single instance of a given class is ever reachable again, i.e. must be loaded, then you can mark a type as \"deleted\" (rather \"unreachable\") in the refactoring mapping. Then the Type Handling will create a dummy TypeHandler that does not need a runtime class. See PersistenceUnreachableTypeHandler. But be careful: if you are mistaken and an instance of such a type is still referenced somewhere and eventually loaded later at runtime, then the Unreachable handler will throw an exception. At some point during the runtime of the application, not even during initialization. The cleanup provides real security: remove all logical gaps and if then with a deleted class no more error in the initialization occurs, it is really superfluous. Any ideas, such as simply returning null in the dummy type handler instead of an instance, are a fire hazard: it may dissolve some annoying situations pleasantly, but it would also mean that existing datasets, potentially entire subgraphs, become hidden from the application. Nevertheless, the database would continue to drag them along, perhaps becoming inexplicably large, and any search for the reason would yield nothing, because the dummy type handler keeps the data records secret. Shortsighted great, but catastrophic in the long run. That’s not good. The only clean solution is: you have to know what to do with your data model. As long as there are still available instances, they must also be loadable. The annoying special case above can be defused without side effects. But it can not be more than that, otherwise it will get rid of the chaos, problems and lost confidence in the correctness of the database solution.","title":"Legacy Type Mapping","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/storage/legacy-type-mapping/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Automatic Mapping","hash":"_automatic_mapping","id":1},{"text":"Explicit Mapping","hash":"_explicit_mapping","id":2},{"text":"Explicit Mapping of Classes","hash":"_explicit_mapping_of_classes","id":3},{"text":"Explicit Mapping Syntax","hash":"_explicit_mapping_syntax","id":4},{"text":"Value Conversion","hash":"_value_conversion","id":5},{"text":"Value Conversion of Primitives","hash":"value-conversion-of-primitives","id":6},{"text":"Value Conversion of References / Objects","hash":"value-conversion-of-references","id":7},{"text":"Performance","hash":"performance","id":8},{"text":"Customizing","hash":"customizing","id":9},{"text":"Special Case: Deleted Class","hash":"special-case-deleted-class","id":10}]},"333":{"id":333,"text":"Here is an overview of how to enable and configure different levels of user interaction for the Legacy Type Mapping. Somewhere you have a foundation instance, a foundation in where everything is configured, from which the StorageManager is created. EmbeddedStorageFoundation foundation = EmbeddedStorage.Foundation(); // or from somewhere else It itself contains a foundation for connections. To access the inner thing needs a little detour. Incidentally, that’s not a JDBC connection, but this is just one thing that creates helper instances like Storer and Loader. Because Legacy Type Mapping affects loading, it has to go in there. Either you access it directly, like this: EmbeddedStorageConnectionFoundation f = foundation.getConnectionFoundation(); Or like this, that’s better for method chaining. foundation.onConnectionFoundation(f -> { ... }); If you have that, the configuration for the Legacy Type Mapping callback logic is just a one liner: f.setLegacyTypeMappingResultor(...); Default PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New() That’s just the necessary logic, without anything further. If you do not change anything, this is done by default. With Console Output PrintingLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) That wraps a printer around the necessary logic. All these storage and persistence classes are nothing sacred or super-duper intertwined or anything. These are just interfaces and if you plug in another implementation then it will be used. Inquiry InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) Resultor which asks the user to apply. More customization is possible, see below. And so on With the implementation of just one single interface method, you can build anything else you can imagine. For example, logging to a file instead of the console. Or in the personally preferred logging framework. Or write confirmed mappings into the refactorings file. Everything is possible. For the inquiring implementation (InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor) there are a few settings: When should he ask? Always or only if something is unclear. Never does not make any sense of course, then you shouldn’t use it, or alternatively the printing resultor. When is a mapping unclear? If at least one field mapping is not completely clear. A field mapping is clear if: If two fields are exactly the same (similarity 1.0 or 100%) Or if two fields are specified by the explicit mapping. So if all fields are clear according to the above rule, then there is no need to ask. And there is another special case: If a field is discarded that is not explicitly marked as discardable, then as a precaution an inquiry is always done. Although no data is lost, but the data would not be available in the application, so better ask. There are options to control this a bit finer. You can optionally specify a double as a threshold (from 0.0 to 1.0, otherwise Exception): The value determines how similar two matching fields automatically have to be so that they are not inquired. Example: The value is 0.9 (90%), but a match found is only 0.8 (80%) similar. This is according to the specification too little, there must be an inquiry as a precaution. If you specify 1.0, that means: always ask, everything is really perfectly clear. If you enter 0.0, this means: never ask or only for implicitly dropping fields. Looks like this: InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New()) // implicitely 1.0 InquiringLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New( PersistenceLegacyTypeMappingResultor.New(), 0.7) // 0.7 threshold Here a small example with a Person class. int customerid ; // -> pin String firstname ; // -> firstName String surname ; // -> lastName String comment ; // discarded, NOT new commerceId It should be changed to: Integer pin ; // firstName surname -0,688----> lastName comment -0,750----> commerceId [***new***] address customerid [discarded] customerid and pin are too different to be automatically assigned to each other. Therefore, it is wrongly assumed that customerid is omitted and pin is new. comment and commerceId are surprisingly similar (75%) and are therefore assigned. But that’s not what we want. Incidentally, it would not matter here what is defined as a threshold: customerid would be eliminated by the implicit decision. This is too delicate not to inquire, so it is always necessary to ask. To get the mapping right, you have to specify two entries: customerid is now called pin and comment should be omitted Then the inquiry looks like this: customerid -[mapped]-> pin firstname -0,944----> firstName surname -0,688----> lastName [***new***] commerceId [***new***] address comment [discarded] Due to the explicit mapping from customerid to pin, the similarity does not matter, it is the mapping that matters. To indicate this, it says \"[mapped]\" instead of the similarity. The rest is as usual. Only comment is now \"[discarded]\", according to the mapping. The difference to the above is namely: This is an explicitly predetermined absence. That does not force inquiry. This clears the way for the threshold: If you enter 0.7 or more then you will be asked. As far as everything would be clear, but the mapping of surname to lastName is below the required \"minimum similarity\", so rather ask. If you enter 0.6 or less, you will no longer be asked. Because all assignments are either explicitly specified or they are according to \"minimum similarity\" similar enough to rely on it. A recommendation for a good value for the \"minimum similarity\" is difficult. As soon as one softens rules, there is always the danger of a mistake. See comment example above: is 75% similar to commerceId. Still wrong. Then prefer 80%? Or 90%? Of course it is better, but the danger is still there. If you want to be sure, just make 1.0 or omit the parameter, then by default 1.0 is taken. The most important is the explicit mapping anyway : if \"enough\" is given by the user, there is no need to ask.","title":"User Interaction","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"user-interaction","url":"/manual/storage/legacy-type-mapping/user-interaction.html","titles":[]},"334":{"id":334,"text":"In some cases, it can be necessary to store modified encapsulated objects that cannot be a accessed from your code. public class ForeignObject { ... private HiddenObject hidden; ... } In the upper code snippet the \"hidden\" object cannot be accessed by store(myForeignObject.hidden) if no getter is available.

This style of work application always works with a copy of the data. Which allows it to use mutable data only within a single thread. The developer doesn’t have to worry about data synchronization and then store this data in a database transaction. This way of working is very practical, it does not require developers to have knowledge of multi-threaded programming and thanks to this it is very widespread. Can similar technical work be used when working with MicroStream? Of course, elegantly, very simply and safely we can use the ObjectCopier utility to create a deep copy of our data, change it, and save it back. Very simple idea, just create a purchase of actual data to work within the application and at the end save that data back. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. If the standard copy function is called over an object in Java, it creates a copy of that object, but the other object’s references remain the same. This doesn’t help so much. Because usually, an application contains a more complex data structure than a single object. This approach is called shallow copy. More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying What is actually needed at this point is a deep copy. You need to create a complete copy of the complete subgraph from this object. MicroStream provides full support for a deep copy. It can be relatively easily called and a deep copy of the data will be created. ObjectCopier objectCopier = ObjectCopier.New(); Customer customer = root.getCustomer(id); Customer customerCopy = objectCopier.copy(customer); customerCopy.addPurchase(purchase); XThreads.executeSynchronized(() -> { root.setCustomer(id, customerCopy); storage.store(root.getcusomers()); } What are the parts of this code? Just create an instance of ObjectCopier class with factory method New(); Get the customer Make a deep copy of the customer object Modify this object graph In synchronized mode save this customer instead of the original customer and store it into a datastore This simple example written in pseudocode aims to demonstrate one of the many ways to solve working over a shared object graph in a multi-threaded environment.

You only need to call the store method on the correct object. The rule is: \"The Object that has been modified has to be stored!\". Storing objects that are not part of an object graph is most likely pointless. See Getting Started how to create a database with a root instance. To store the registered root instance just call the storeRoot() method of a EmbeddedStorageManager instance. // Init storage manager final EmbeddedStorageManager storageManager = EmbeddedStorage.start(root); // Store the root object storageManager.storeRoot(); To store a newly created object, store the \"owner\" of the object.

The most common use cases are: Second-level cache in JPA (e.g. Hibernate) Spring Cache Abstraction and many more Why another JCache implementation, you may wonder. There is already a myriad of providers out there. MicroStream’s very own serialization and storage can be utilized to get the best out of caches. For example, you are not limited to java.io.Serializable types, when storing a value. That means every key-value pair gets copied every time you put and get entries in and out of a cache. And if a cache is used with a backing store, MicroStream’s storage can be used to get the best possible performance. And now, MicroStream being a JCache provider, you can use it as a drop-in replacement in your existing application. The caching provider represents the implementation of JCache that you are using. You can use more than one JCache implementation in your project if you wish, and CachingProvider is how you access the different providers that are in use. It is responsible for managing and providing access to many named caches. The cache holds the different values being cached. You can have several caches, each of which may be holding data for a different purpose. Each one can have a different configuration; for example, different caches may evict old data using different techniques. Each item of data in a cache is an entry, which is a key-value pair. The key is a unique value used to store and look up the data. The value is the actual data you wish to cache. Caches have some different properties than Maps, but the calls that you would use to store and lookup data is very similar.","title":"Cache","component":"manual","version":"master","name":"index","url":"/manual/cache/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Motivation","hash":"_motivation","id":1},{"text":"Basic Concepts of JCache","hash":"_basic_concepts_of_jcache","id":2},{"text":"CachingProvider","hash":"_cachingprovider","id":3},{"text":"CacheManager","hash":"_cachemanager","id":4},{"text":"Cache","hash":"_cache","id":5},{"text":"Entry","hash":"_entry","id":6}]},"342":{"id":342,"text":"Since version 7 Microstream provides a module for simple object based network communication over TCP connections. This module utilizes the Microstream engine to serialize and deserialize java objects and provides additional APIs to setup the required TCP connections. If using Maven just add module microstream-communication-binary into your pom.xml dependencies. pom.xml one.microstream microstream-communication-binary 08.00.00-MS-GA The Hello World example consists out of two applications. The Host and the Client application. The Host will open a network port and listen for incoming connections of the client. If a client connects successfully it awaits data from the client that will be send back to the client. The basic example won’t do any configuration so the connection is not secured and the client and host use the local system address at port 1099. public class EchoServer { public static void main(final String[] args) { final ComHost host = ComBinaryDynamic.Foundation() .setHostChannelAcceptor(channel -> { final Object received = channel.receive(); System.out.println(\"received: \" + received); channel.send(received); }) .createHost(); // run the host, making it constantly listen for new connections and relaying them to the logic host.run(); } } public class EchoClient { public static void main(final String[] args) { //create the client final ComClient client = ComBinaryDynamic.Foundation() .createClient(); //connect to the host and communicate try(final ComChannel channel = client.connect()) { channel.send(\"Hello Host\"); final Object received = channel.receive(); System.out.println(\"received: \" + received); } } } Configuration of host and client is done using the ComFoundation.Default implementation of the ComFoundation interface. To get a preconfigured foundation instance the classes ComBinaryDynamic and ComBinary provide the convenient method Foundation(). The Object communication of Microstream is available in two flavors: Dynamic and non dynamic. They differ in the way classes that should be serialized and transfered are handled: The non dynamic version requires all classes that should be transfered to be registered at initialization time. This can be done with the registerEntityType methods of the ComFoundation. If a transfered object graph references any unregistered class an exception will occur! The dynamic implementation automatically registers all classes that are part of the communication at runtime. It will also do a type-mapping if classes with the same name have different implementations on client and host. host binding address The host’s IP address is configured with ComFoundation.setHostBindingAddress(InetSocketAddress). client target address The address the client connects to is configured by ComFoundation.setClientTargetAddress(InetSocketAddress). port only If no host or client target address is configured it is possible to use ComFoundation.setPort(int) to set a port that is used together with the default ip addresses for host and client. registering entity types to register entity types at startup use ComFoundation.registerEntityTypes(Class…​) for example. In order to use TLS encrypted communication you need to setup a ComTLSConnectionHandler and supply it using ComFoundation.setConnectionHandler(ComConnectionHandler). The default implementation of the ComTLSConnectionHandler uses the java SSLEngine .
